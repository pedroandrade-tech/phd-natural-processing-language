1,"Confusing and Confused Movie

Nicole Kidman is giving a performance in ""Babygirl"" that no doubt many
people will be calling ""brave,"" mostly because it suggests that women
over the age of 50 (gasp!) like to have sex and maybe even like to get
kinky once in a while.

She does give a good performance, and it's the movie's biggest selling
point. It's a shame that by the time the film is over her performance
has been diluted by a muddled screenplay that doesn't know what it wants
to say about gender dynamics or the sexual power play between men and
women. Maybe confusion is the point, because Kidman's character doesn't
completely know what she wants. She enjoys her place as a powerful
female leader in the professional world, but she also enjoys
relinquishing that power in the bedroom and giving into submissive
fantasies. But only up to a point -- submissiveness for women can
quickly veer into uncomfortable territory if taken too far by the man
they're with. Scary can be fun, but after a certain line is crossed,
scary is just scary.

I applaud a film that's honest about female sexuality, but I wish the
topic had been given a better movie than this.

3,"This Baby Has Some Growing Up To Do

A lot has been said about Babygirl, mostly involving Kidman's
performance. The remainder of chatter has been about the uniqueness of
its story and how it pushes boundaries around this topic. Unfortunately
I have issues with both of those talking points: yes, Kidman does push
herself to new territory she has not necessarily been to before as an
actor, but it's really just her very personal artistic growth but not
one the audience actually shares in. This story/script doesn't really
cover anything new. It's basically an older woman in power cheating on
her husband with a much younger man. I've seen this story numerous times
before and some of them were better told. Sure, their specific sexual
dynamic is not as common but it just all seemed so familiar. If it were
a lesser known actress in the lead novel one would be talking about
Babygirl, because it just doesn't warrant it. As for Kidman's
performance, she does nail the sex scenes quite well but otherwise her
character isn't that interesting and she's done much better work in
numerous other films.",5
4,"One of these comes around every decade

Fatal Attraction, 9 1/2 Weeks, Unfaithful, 50 Shades etc - one of these
moody, erotic films comes along about once a decade. Everyone either
gets off a little, clutches their pearls or sees it for it is - a sexual
fluff piece. They are almost always shot really gracefully and the
cinematography is also always on point. Fine acting and a smoking hot
couple for everyone in the audience to have a little something. The
difference here is the all woman collaboration which was probably a
really attractive draw for these actors - to see how this film in a
genre dominated by Adrian Lyne compares. I can't believe I'm going to
say this because I really enjoy her but I don't think Kidman was the
right casting for the lead. She's beautiful, aging beautifully and has
give some really good performances over the years - I didn't like this
one. And the dude is cute but a little creepy too. It was entertaining
and a little jaw dropping but the story and especially the ending was
really clunky.",6
5,"Tame erotica

What really carries this film are the two excellent central performances
from Nicole Kidman and Harris Dickinson. Without them, this film would
be entirely forgettable, particularly because this film doesn't really
break new ground in its genre and the plot is thin. Sophie Wilde and
Antonio Banderas are also good in their supporting roles. Kidman is
great in portraying a woman who wants to sink into her desires, but is
constantly conflicted in doing so.

The score, soundtrack, atmosphere, the costumes Kidman wears, and
cinematography all really elevate this film. The film feels very cold
and aloof, which is in keeping with our protagonist. As alluded to
earlier, the film's biggest issue is that the story is tenuous and not
really anything new. It's surprisingly tame for what it is. It almost
felt like the film was self-conscious and scared to really go there and
be prurient. But perhaps that was intentional, to mirror Romy's
reluctance to go there herself. While there is some nudity, it never
really feels sexy. Perhaps that was the director's intent though. While
sex scenes in erotic thrillers tend to be sexy, passionate, salacious,
almost fantastical, the sex scenes in this film feel very organic, and
even awkward at times. Between Romy and Samuel there are awkward
silences, confusions as to what to do next, insecurities about intimacy.
The result is that you feel like a fly on the wall. However, as a
viewer, that is both positive and negative. Positive because it feels
realistic, perhaps relatable. But negative because much of the film is
difficult to watch. What really would have elevated this film is
fleshing out Romy's past and her dark desires.

A nitpick I had with the film is regarding Samuel's tattoos. It felt
like he was a walking bad-boy stereotype; the tats felt a bit too
on-the-nose and obvious. Dickinson's presence alone was sufficient
enough to signal to the audience his dark, dominant interiority.
Dovetailing off of that point: while it was refreshing to see a power
dynamic in a film wherein the younger of the two parties has the power,
as it's typically portrayed as being the inverse, the abrupt jump from
new intern to a forbidden affair with his boss was jarring and
implausible, if we are to believe this film takes place in reality. But
the director's conceit here very well may be a heightened version of
reality, a fantasy.

That being said, the film is worth checking out, if only for the great
acting.",6

8,"Complete waste of time!

I can't get over how much my husband and I did not like this movie.
There's nothing to it except too much of Nicole Kidman panting. The plot
is boring, scenes are drawn out, and there's no character development. I
didn't care what was going to happen and I thought it wasn't believable.
There's no way some young intern would behave the way he did and not get
fired. He was way too confident and weird. I really would just like my
money back and move on. Warning to anyone who's sensitive to
jumpy/blurry filming style, there's a lot of it. I had to close my eyes
sometimes to avoid getting a headache. Basically this was an entirely
forgettable movie.",1
9,"The film's ending is superficial and ludicrous

It's a drama about sexual fantasy and control set in December in modern
New York City. The family in question is 50-ish high-powered executive
Romy Mathis (Nicole Kidman), her Broadway play director husband, Jacob
(Antonio Banderas), and their two teenage daughters, Isabel (Esther
McGregor) and Nora (Vaughan Reilly). Romy is highly successful and
innovative at her job but sexually unsatisfied in her marriage.

Romy meets Samuel (Harris Dickinson), a 25-ish intern at her company,
who she is attracted to because of his assertive behavior. His behavior
and her fantasies collide in a relationship with predictable problems,
including Samuel also dating Romy's assistant, Esme (Sophie Wilde).
After things get out of control, there is climactic conflict and
resolution.

""Babygirl"" is a virtuoso Nicole Kidman performance. That's the best that
I can say for the film. Harris Dickinson is adequate as a manipulative
jerk, as is Antonio Banderas as a preoccupied husband. Esther McGregor
has a nice little subplot in the film. ""Babygirl"" is no feminist movie,
and there are no attractive characters. The film's ending is superficial
and ludicrous. The cinematography is creative at points, and the sex
scenes are not graphic. However, any ""truth"" in ""Babygirl"" is lost in
the unrealistic ending.",6

11,"Not for those who don't understand kink

This film does a much better job at capturing the dynamics involved in
power exchange kinkiness than any other big box film ever made. For the
vanilla, who'll undoubtedly expect a love story: this is not for you.
Definitely NOT a film intended for the vanilla, nor the sexually
dissonant masses who'll likely only engage the film from a place of
prurience and confusion. This film does an amazing job of portraying the
nuances and and inculcated elements of self-denial so prevalent in
western societies. It seems self-evident that this is why the film is
met with low ratings by many viewers.

Kidman is clearly very invested in this role, and that makes the film
that much more enjoyable. Excellent and authentic casting that seemed
real and possible, rather that the fake Hollywood pairings that mass
consumers have unfortunately become accustomed to in films involving
couples.",9
12,"Good girl

This is not the movie I was hoping for. It felt awkward at times, with
cringe worthy scenes. As much as I enjoyed Nicole Kidman, Harris
Dickinson was not enjoyable for me on screen. I felt like it could have
been sexier, and more kink satisfying. I literally laughed at some
scenes when I should have enjoyed them. A theme I'm into, but this
wasn't it for me. Antonio Banderas was a perfect fit for the part! You
felt for the husband, and i bought his pain. I really wish this would
have been better, but as it is, I don't think I'd care to ever watch it
again.

13,"""Baby Girl"" - A Film Without Purpose

There's something particularly maddening about a movie that demands two
hours of your life but gives absolutely nothing in return. ""Baby Girl""
is one such disaster-a bewildering, pointless exercise in bad
storytelling, uninspired direction, and empty performances.

The film struggles from the outset, failing to establish any meaningful
plot or purpose. Its attempt at being profound is laughable at best,
with scenes meandering aimlessly, leaving viewers questioning why
they're still watching. Any hint of a narrative is buried under layers
of incoherent dialogue, abrupt tonal shifts, and characters so shallow
they could evaporate in direct sunlight.

The protagonist-if you can even call her that-spends most of the film
alternating between brooding and making incomprehensible decisions. Her
motivations are never clear, and by the time the credits roll, you're
left wondering if the writers even knew what they were trying to
achieve. The supporting cast fares no better, delivering stilted
performances that seem more fitting for a community theater audition
than a feature film.

Visually, ""Baby Girl"" offers little to redeem itself. The cinematography
is uninspired, with a bland color palette and unimaginative framing.
Even the soundtrack-typically a saving grace for many films-is
forgettable, leaving scenes feeling even more lifeless than they already
are.

Perhaps the most damning aspect of ""Baby Girl"" is its utter lack of
direction. It's as though the filmmakers had a vague idea but no clue
how to execute it. The result is a film that's not just bad-it's utterly
pointless. There's no emotional payoff, no engaging story, and certainly
no reason for anyone to endure it.

If you're looking for a movie to hate-watch, ""Baby Girl"" might fit the
bill. But for anyone hoping to be entertained, moved, or even mildly
interested, steer clear. Life's too short for films like this.",1
14,Desire Without Shame,7
15,"Not a thriller, just a so-so drama

In the genre of ""erotic thriller"" it is typically the male that is
portrayed as the cheating spouse who gets caught up with the femme
fatale.

Here, the role is reversed... it's the middle-aged career woman seeking
sexual satisfaction outside her marriage with a younger co-worker.

Despite what some reviews here suggest though, this is not an audacious
concept. It has been mined in such movies as Unfaithful and Ryan's
Daughter.

And for a movie being marketed as an erotic thriller/mystery, there's
none of that here. It's just a straight up drama more in the vein of
9-1/2 Weeks than movies such as Fatal Attraction or Body Heat.

There's a hint of what could have been in just one scene where Kidman's
philandering corporate officer and her younger lover threaten each other
with exposure. Which of them has the better ammo? We'll never know
because the subject is never broached again.

Kidman deserves nods for leaning hard into her role as the unsatisfied
wife who has kept a lid on her darker desires during the course of her
marriage. Unfortunately, the younger man she takes on, Harris Dickinson,
is no match for her. He doesn't have the gravitas or screen presence to
suggest that Kidman's character would be at all interested in him.

An okay one-of watch for Kidman's performance.",6
16,"Many motifs that lead nowhere

This movie fails to engage the viewer's empathy for or interest in any
of the characters, and thus fails to create either belief or suspension
of disbelief.

A large part of the problem lies in the confused montage of
themes/motifs throughout the film. In the opening sequence, Romy
pretends to have an orgasm with her husband, but then leaves the room to
masturbate to porn. This idea could have been explored and developed
along a very interesting route, however, it's never picked up on again.
Instead, later in the film we hear about Romy's needing to have an
element of danger to have an orgasm - a completely different idea.

Also early in the film, there's a scene where the intern subdues a
violent dog. Presumably Romy relates to the dog and wants to be subdued
by the intern. The dog imagery is confused in the middle of the film by
Romy actually acting like a cat (lapping milk from a saucer while on all
fours). The dog disappears until practically the last scene, when we see
it winding around the intern's legs.

These kinds of disconnections and confusions occur repeatedly throughout
the film. You just feel the movie is all over the place and doesn't make
sense, and you're being asked to care about a character's orgasm when
nothing about it is interesting at all. Silly ideas are presented to us
without any background or development as to why they came to be, or why
they're significant.

Additionally, there is curiously zero onscreen physical chemistry
between either Romy and her husband, or Romy and the intern. You wonder
how the cast was chosen.

I'm surprised Kidman took this on. I spent the greater part of the two
hours wishing it would end.",1
17,"Time to grow up, Babygirl

Maybe if young actor Harrison Dickinson didn't play such a smug,
arrogant creep, it would be easier to believe Nichole Kidman's character
could instantly develop such a dangerous attraction to him in the new
erotic thriller ""Babygirl."" And maybe if there weren't a real person
named Luigi Mangione seducing millions of social media followers with a
similar posture of sexy entitlement as he faces murder charges for a
cold-blooded killing, it would be easier to dismiss this kinky drama
written and directed by Halina Reijn as pure fantasy.

Either way, the movie is pretty much of a mess.

It's getting a bit of buzz at the moment for Kidman's recent Golden
Globe nomination, and for the - gasp - lengths she went to to earn it.

In case you've missed the sizzling ad campaigns, ""Babygirl"" opens with
an apparently nude Nicole testing the limits of R-ratings in the throes
of passionate lovemaking with her husband (Antonio Banderas). As though
that's not steamy enough, she finishes up with a kinky encore orgasm in
front of her computer screen.

All this before the opening credits, and the scenes establishing her
character Romy Mathis as the founder and CEO of a cutting-edge company
that's streamlining Amazon-style commerce with robotics.

With her successful playwright husband, two beautiful teenage daughters,
a corner office with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the Manhattan
skyline, a penthouse and a mansion in the country, Romy's got it all.
And she rules her domain with aloof, absolute control.

At least until the intern shows up.

His name is Samuel (Dickinson) and they meet by accident when he saves
her from a savage German Shepherd attack on the sidewalk in front of her
office. Later that morning she is formally introduced to the dog
whisperer as a member of her company's incoming class of interns.

Samuel stands out of the crowd - at 6-foot-2 he towers over them,
actually - but this doesn't explain why Romy can't keep her eyes off the
condescending sneer usually on his face. He makes his disregard for her
authority clear from the get-go, with the kind of attitude that would a
guy fired, pronto, in any corporate setting in anyplace remotely
resembling the real world.

Instead, Romy chooses to risk everything she has created and built in
her corporate empire and perfect family to get him to practice some of
that dog whispering on her.

What follows is lots, and lots, of seedy hotel rooms, office desk tops
and even a rave, for her to keep discovering how low can she go. Turns
out she was faking it in her perfect world. This
young-enough-to-be-her-son lover is offering her a way out ... she
thinks, and she's willing to commit career suicide to prove it.

Last year Emma Stone won the Oscar and a Golden Globe for her bold foray
into sexuality in the brilliant ""Poor Things."" She made sex mainstream
for awards season.

Kidman gets points for guts for following Emma's lead, and for still
having an if-you've-got-it-flaunt-it body in her late 50s. But she still
comes in a distant second to Stone's groundbreaking performance, which
sealed the deal with a healthy sense of humor on the whole subject of
sex.

Besides the corporate backstabbing and snake pit treachery, there are
themes of fragile family dynamics along with Romy seriously twisted
psyche in ""Babygirl."" But that's not what the audience has come to see.

Unfortunately, for those of us who never got the concept of power as an
aphrodisiac, or are color-blind when it comes to differentiating 50
shades of gray, Reijn's screenplay doesn't make much sense. The
eroticism the publicists are banking on gets tedious in a hurry, and
would be of even less interest if it weren't Nicole Kidman up there,
baring it almost all.

She remains one of the most versatile actresses on screen today, but
""Babygirl"" is at best a sideways step rather than a thrilling advance in
her brilliant career.",6
18,"Ugh...more like Babyhurl

This is the biggest cringe-fest I have seen in ages. I expected
something at least interesting or sexy. Yuck...there is no sexiness to
be found here. There is zero chemistry between Nicole Kidman and the
young dude, no proper build up to their relationship or whatever the
hell it is, and the director appears clueless as to what she's making.

The best part of the whole damn movie is when the daughter asks Kidman
why she puts that crap in her face because she looks like a dead fish
because it's what we all really want to know. Why is she doing this to
her face? Does she think it looks good? It looks ridiculous and the
weird unnatural face is very distracting on a big screen.

The dead, unmoving ""fish face"" has taken away her previous acting
abilities and she's completely flat here. Her face is expressionless,
even as hard as she's trying (and she's trying hard), but the 800 units
of Botox and 30 syringes of filler is hard to defeat. She looks
embalmed, and on top of it her breasts look like two hard rocks. Why is
she continuing to play these supposed ""sexy"" parts? Nicole, you look
like a plastic grandma please just stop. It's becoming stomach churning.

But nothing in the entire film is as stomach churning as Samuel's
""dance"" to George Michael's Father Figure. Seriously? I'm still trying
to recover from the cringe. What sort of dance moves are those? Is this
supposed to be sexy? Who are the people who find this sexy?

I haven't been this irritated by a movie in quite some time. This is the
crap that is going to put theaters out of business. Save your money and
watch the trailer because there is nothing more to see and a whole lot
you will wish you hadn't seen.",1
19,"While not flawless, there's much to appreciate here.

My wife and I saw Babygirl (2024) in theaters this evening. The
storyline centers on a New York CEO married to a Broadway play director.
She harbors a deep, dark sexual urge that her husband cannot satisfy.
When an interim employee joins her company, he notices something about
her, and she notices him-setting the stage for her darkest desires to be

This film is written and directed by Halina Reijn (Bodies Bodies Bodies)
and stars Nicole Kidman (Cold Mountain), Harris Dickinson (County
Lines), Antonio Banderas (The 13th Warrior), Sophie Wilde (Talk to Me),
and Esther McGregor (Obi-Wan Kenobi).

This is a unique and well-crafted film. It explores intriguing
intricacies surrounding unfulfilled desires, highlighting how they can
consume a person when finally realized, becoming as addictive and
destructive as a drug. Kidman delivers an elite performance, portraying
her character's internal struggles with nuance and depth. The storyline
is smart, with indirect analogies to AI and the complexities of the
human mind adding layers of thoughtfulness. The cinematography,
wardrobe, and settings are exceptional, fully immersing the viewer in
the film's world. While not flawless, there's much to appreciate here.

22,"full of fantasy

This film is really different from other love affairs between young
girls and young girls this year. The focus is not on having an affair
with a young girl, but on the heroine as a middle-aged person trying to
explore her long-standing sexual fantasies and struggling with whether
to face the reality. Self, or suppressing and covering up the need to be
a normal person. Because what she likes is not young meat, but
alternative sexual fetishes. Moreover, in several other old-young
romances, the woman is single (widowed or divorced). The purpose is to
avoid moral condemnation and just to please the female audience, so they
are all presented in the form of romantic comedies. But this film deals
with ethics such as cheating and inappropriate behavior in the
workplace, and emphasizes the heroine's inner condemnation, shame, and
desire to stop. Therefore, it is no longer a comedy or fantasy, but is
presented in a suspense-thriller manner, and it explores not love but
self-awareness.",6

28,"Asks Too Much of the Audience

'Babygirl' asks too much of its audience. We're asked to believe in
Nicole Kidman's character Romy as the CEO of a Robotics firm. We're
asked to believe in a CEO who spends no time in the office and all her
time making love with an intern. We're asked to believe in - not love at
first sight - but eager submissiveness at first sight. As well as the
reverse; a young character played by Harrison Dickenson knowing at first
sight that he can dominate another (one who just happens to be his CEO).
Too much. So much that these 'asks' bothered me even in many of the
film's most sexually adventurous interludes. And that's saying a lot.

The film is all about sexual gratification; two characters who need the
playing out of power and submission to truly get off. As Kidman's
character tells her husband of nineteen years (Antonio Banderas), With
you I've never had an orgasm.

Well she certainly does 'get off' with Dickenson, and I have to say that
Kidman's performance during these scenes was truly riveting. Despite
what I wrote above, there were instances when Kidman's transformation
into a helpless young woman, or an ecstatic recipient of pleasure, left
me totally engaged.

The film has a sub-plot which for me did not work. Something about women
in the workplace; how they should be promoted more widely, and protected
more vigorously. There is the office creep who tries to take advantage
of Kidman's situation, as well as the office-climber who does the same.

Harris Dickenson is cold and dangerous in his role as the all-powerful.
There is in his eyes a willingness - I thought - to push all the
emotional / erotic buttons. A coldness with nothing more at stake than
holding power. He cares nothing about professional advancement for
himself, he just wants blind submission. And gets it.

As for the film's ending, it was - for me - something of a surprise. For
others, I imagine, it was easily predicted. Either way, the best thing
about it was that the picture was soon over.",3
29,"Nicole Kidman excels in a fairly engaging erotic thriller.

Babygirl review :

Released in Indian cinemas last month and now available for rent on
Amazon Prime; Babygirl is a fairly engaging erotic thriller, which
relies solely on the star power of the lovely Nicole Kidman.

Nicole plays Romy, the CEO of a Robotics company having a kinky torrid
affair with her much younger intern Samuel (Harris Dickinson). She ain't
getting orgasm from her hubby (Antonio Banderas, efficient) and longs
for rough and roleplay based lovemaking, which Samuel gives her
aplenty!!

Contrary to expectation, the sex scenes are aesthetically shot, with
camera angles suggesting more and showing less. The basic plot is
similar to The Boy Next Door (2015), which also had a mature woman
getting involved with her much younger intern (student). Babygirl is
much better than that J Lo movie.

In fact, Babygirl is quite good for a cosy one time watch. Nicole
Kidman, at fifty seven years, still rocks it big time. As for the
uncanny title, we get to know its significance over an immortal George
Michael song. Wow!!

Nicole Kidman and Harris Dickinson are the oxygen tanks keeping Babygirl

broken espresso machine at a sad Parisian café. Kidman nails the
performance of a woman dangling between hunger and horror, watching her
war with herself is way more gripping than anything happening in the
plot.

Sophie Wilde and Antonio Banderas pull strong supporting duty, and the
cinematography, soundtrack, and wardrobe are luxurious. Everything looks
cold, aloof, and expensive - exactly like Romy's emotional interior.
It's beautiful... but it's also kind of distant homework to watch.

The biggest issue? The story flinches when it should stab. Babygirl
wants to be an erotic thriller, but it's too self-conscious to fully
unbutton its own shirt. The sex scenes feel real and awkward (good?),
but also neutered (bad?). You're a fly on the wall - but sometimes that

AT ONCE, X, and UNCUT GEMS, so although you may know the genre, they
often take them in bold scary new places, and that is exactly what
happens in BABYGIRL. Kidman is dynamite in a role where even up to the
end, you're not quite sure if she's the victim, the aggressor, the hero,
or the villain. Credit to writer/director Halina Reijn, who directed a
clever new take on the slasher film with BODIES, BODIES, BODIES, for
crafting a story where it's unclear who's in the right and who's in the
wrong. On the downside, I found the actor who played the intern, Harris
Dickinson, kind of annoying, though maybe that was a choice by the
filmmakers. I would have bought into the situation more if there was a
more charming and attractive young intern, say Austin Butler, and
someone less ""Jersey Shore."" Still, despite this, it's a fascinating
film that I did not know how it was going to end, which is more than you
can say for most films. Antonio Banderas also appears in the film as
Kidman's cuckold husband.",7
36,"Absolutely the worst, left feeling cringy and ick

Talk about misleading, the trailers caught my attention. But likely lead
me to believe more than the movie was intended to be, what a complete
let down. What I hoped for was something like a cross between 50 Shades
and Magic Mike; strong, confident, sensuality, chemistry and sexual
desire but instead left feeling cringy and ick!

From the beginning of the movie til the very last moment it was
disappointing. Zero sensuality, no emotional connection, neither actor
lured you in with their performance! Romy (NK) didn't portray a high
powered confident CEO, but rather one who was mentally weak and
deranged. And the young intern Samuel was nothing to be desired,
together they lacked depth.",1
37,"Emotionally Riveting

I am not sure if I liked this movie. I am not sure if it is good. There
are moments that it infuriated me. It is a sexually charged, and,
sometimes, perverse movie about a successful tech executive who is
sexually repressed and becomes involved with a manipulative intern.
Nicole Kidman is revoting in this. She is confusing and sexy and
vulnerable and difficult to watch because she is so good as the woman
becoming unhinged. Antonia Banderas is great as the husband. Harris
Dickerson is good in the role, and very easy to hate. The movie made me
think and it, definitely, turned me on at times. Worth Seeing for its
unique and Adult character.",7

to this movie. Reviews seemed mixed and given that most of these types
of movies are terrible my expectations were low to start with. However,
this movie turned out to be way worse than anything I have ever seen.
The acting is static, the dialogues are completely unrealistic and
robotic, the plastic fantastic Nicole Kidman crawling and rolling over
the floor made me sick, the absolute lack of spark between characters
made this excruciating. There is absolutely no redeemable factor I can
say about this movie. No build up nothing just randomly have all the
weirdness unfold. Before saying anything, I'm Dutch and not a prude by a
long shot but the movie was just weird kinks in a vanilla jacket for no
reason. I went there while suffering from kidneystones for a week
already but honestly I'd rather have those for another month than having
to sit through 2 hours of this torturous ordeal ever again. Absolutely
must avoid this at all costs. Not overstating that this may be the worst
movie I have ever seen. Not having paid the ticket price I still felt
scammed.",1
39,"Ds written from a female's perspective

There are so many movies like ""Babygirl"" that don't understand the
emotion behind things like infidelity, power, and lust, using them as
devices instead of primal aspects of the human condition. When one is
done this well, it feels like a bolt of lightning.

Reijn is unafraid to have her characters play out all the wobbles that
come with negotiating one another's boundaries, reinforcing how pleasure
comes from good communication. That the Dutch female director manages to
do so while crafting some of the hottest sex scenes in a major film in
years and without dropping the ball in pacing this satire on the era of
the politically correct feels almost impossible.

Babygirl is that movie and most likely because it's subject matter is
written from a female perspective.",8
40,"A little bit weird... but I enjoyed it.

'Babygirl' is animalistic, raw, and sensual. I heard so many bad things
before the movie, but it is surprisingly better than expected. It's hard
to grasp for sure, and almost all sex scenes are discomforting. I mean,
come on. It's a sexual scene, and Samuel treats Romy exactly as he
treats a dog. It's not just one scene. Throughout the movie, it keeps
implying that Romy WANTS TO be treated like an inferior and humiliated.
At the same time, she's a successful woman in the business world and a
role model figure. This gap is effectively and persistently described.
Plot organization is strong. The music is sexy.

However, Nicole Kidman's face and acting. She really should stop with
botox. Her face is awkward for two hours. She keeps whispering with her
lips forward as if she's about to kiss in every single scene.",7

This is an embarrassing laughable movie of thriller cliches and Nicole

this before and more importantly, we've seen much better. I honestly
don't understand why she puts herself in these flicks. She's beyond it.

that in many years.

Watching Babygirl made me feel a bit uncomfortable at times, and I had
to constantly remind myself that if the roles were reversed, it wouldn't

films like this, where the woman is the older figure-challenging
societal norms and encouraging open-mindedness.

Once I actively tried to detach from preconceived biases about age gaps
and avoided kink-shaming, I found that the movie wasn't bad at all. In
fact, it was quite interesting, and the actors delivered solid
performances. The film leans more into metaphorical storytelling than
chronological logic, and I believe its purpose extends beyond just
telling a story-it also serves as a form of education.

While it may not be for everyone, Babygirl is definitely a
thought-provoking watch that lingers in your mind long after it ends.",7

I can handle steamy scenes when they serve a purpose. But Babygirl isn't
erotic. It's clinical. Like the director thought, ""What if we filmed
Nicole Kidman's pores having an existential crisis?"" Close-up after
close-up of heavy breathing, trembling lips, and... other activities..

The plot? Something about power dynamics and forbidden desire. Couldn't
tell you much, because the camera was too busy playing dermatologist on
Kidman's cheekbones to bother with pesky things like dialogue or
character development. At one point, I swear the lens was so far up her
personal space that I could see her thoughts.

Kidman commits, because she's a legend. But this isn't Eyes Wide Shut
artistry-it's Fifty Shades of Yawn with a Criterion Collection filter.
The movie mistakes uncomfortable for deep, and lingering for meaningful.
By the 17th prolonged sigh into the abyss of a candlelit close-up, I was
sighing too-out of sheer exhaustion.

46,"Baby Girl needs to go to her room and stay there

We have seen this movie done many times, and done so much better. That
is the most infuriating thing. This story can be done right with
emotion, sensuality, and intensity. This had none of that. What it
lacked the most and its biggest downfall; it had zero believability.
None with the characters, the plot, or the backstory. There is just one
person in this entire journey that you feel for, and you feel for him
because of the only decent performance worth mentioning. And even he
gets shafted with a horrible story arch before it is all said and done.

The foundation was intriguing. A brilliant, married, business woman with
past drama starts a lurid affair with a young intern. Lifetime built an
entire channel around that premise. Nicole Kidman as the lead is also
excitable. She is a beautiful, seasoned actress who exudes power. But
mother of pearl inlay this was just a squandered use of all of those
building blocks.

Baby Girl's story, though understandable, is ultra thin. We get a small
glimpse as to how Romy (Nicole Kidman) rose to heights in the business
world. It is fuzzy who does what at the company and what if anything
takes place there. They bring in a new group of interns including a
pompous, mouthy, brat named Samuel (Harris Dickinson). He immediately
picks up on Romy's kinks and uses them to somehow manipulate her into
risking everything. By this point in the film it is established that
Romy has some serious issues when it comes to sex. Either from her past
- which is touched on but never really explained - or trying to deal
with her powerful position.

The chemistry between Kidman and Dickinson is void of any sort of magic
or allure. We simply do not believe it. And when scenes such as what we
get in this movie which live and breath on chemistry, when it is not
there, it just becomes sad and laughable. Samuel comes off as a spoiled
punk and you sort of hate him from the jump. That makes it even harder
to believe that Romy would be the least bit interested in this guy; kink
or no kink. She could find better on Google.

At the heart of this is also Romy's husband (Jacob) Antonio Banderas.
Jacob is a loving, patient, caring man who tries his best to understand
and come along side Romy. There is no doubt that they have intimacy
issues but you get the feeling that they are pushed dwon instead of
talked about. Even as he finds out about the affair he is fair and
reacts as expected. Banderas is the one person in this film actor and
character I could have empathy for. (Side note) - If you get tired of
the movie and want to find a way to entertain yourself. Just close your
eyes. All the scenes with Banderas now feel like a Puss N Boots movie.

The biggest disappointment and shocker is that the film is written and
directed by a woman. Halina Reijn is a capable film maker on both sides
of the camera. If anyone should be able to convey what she wants Romy to
convey it is her. If a guy made this film I would get the disconnect. I
would tell him to stop trying to get inside a woman's head about these
things. But here there is no excuse for what we get from the story and
performances.

Baby Girl is rated R for strong sexual content, nudity and language.
Even before the first scene comes into focus you know what this movie is
about. Make sure you are comfortable with who you are seeing it with,
and that you are both mature enough not to giggle during the sexy
scenes.

any.",1

As ""Babygirl"" (2024 release; 115 min) opens, a couple is making love.
Afterwards, the woman leaves the bedroom and watches porn on her
computer. Turns it this is Romy Mathis, the CEO of a successful
warehouse automation company. A new group of interns starts at the
company, and there seems to be a strange vibe between Romy and Samuel,
an intern... At this point we are less than 10 minutes into the movie.

Couple of comments: this movie is billed as an ""erotic thriller"", and
let me just say it: there is nothing ""erotic"" or ""thrilling"" about this
movie. I was aware of the premise of the movie before seeing this, and
all I can tell you is that the way the premise played out on the screen
lacked any and all credibility. The longer I watched this, the less I
was interested in it. Nicole ""Ice Queen"" Kidman tries her best.
Up-and-coming English actor Harris Dickinson is utterly mismatched. I
saw no chemistry between these two, and it all felt so... staged. I was
incredibly disappointed, to the point where I literally walked out of
the theater halfway through the movie. I have to admit that I have read
a number of reviews, many quite positive, and I just could not match it
up with my own personal viewing experience of this.

""Babygirl"" premiered at the Venice Film Festival to good acclaim, and in
particular Nicole Kidman's performance has generated potential buzz at
the upcoming awards season. If you are in the mood for a supposed
""erotic thriller"" or simply are a fan of Nicole Kidman, I'd suggest you
check it out, and draw your own conclusion. For me ""Babygirl"" is one of
the worst movies of 2024.",3

Baby Girl is a deeply moving and beautifully nuanced film that took me
by surprise. It offers a rare and honest glimpse into the inner world of
a woman, her strength, her vulnerability, and her hidden desires. What
struck me most was how unapologetically human the main character is.
She's not just strong or just fragile, she's both, all at once.

The way the film explores female sexuality felt raw, real, and
refreshingly unfiltered. There's a quiet power in the way it doesn't try
to explain or justify her longing, it simply shows it. And in doing so,
it touched something deep in me.",9

52,"Babygirl

While not as illuminating on the subject of adultery as I'd hoped, I
would still say there are enough solid moments and character
interactions to consider this worth the watch.

Nicole Kidman is pretty good in this, especially as the chaos of her
situation gradually increased in intensity. Her stress and internal
conflict is palpable. Early on, it's established that she isn't being
satisfied intimately by her doting husband, and I thought how they
conveyed that frustration was subtle yet effective. While it doesn't
completely answer why Kidman's Romy would jeopardize everything good in
her life for a fantasy, it does lay important groundwork that pays off
later.

Maybe it is that drawn out confusion as to the reasoning for this self
sabotage that makes the acts themselves feel kind of...hollow? Like, I
could sense the passion on screen for sure, but I wasn't completely
buying that she was truly getting what she wanted out of it. I think
after she got a taste of what pulling out of the situation would mean,
it became evident that she was addicted to the danger that it introduced
to her life more so than how the sex made her feel.

It's that last point that is almost spelled out for us in what is the
best scene of the film: the moment it stops being a secret. Antonio
Banderas really steps up his performance as a man who has to comes to
term with what has happened behind his back, and Romy and Sam are
finally forced to come to reality. I enjoyed the conclusion for the most
part. Romy's parting fantasy is a bit complicated and seems regressive
for her development, but it speaks to the fact that humans can't just
let go of things that deeply affect them-regardless of morality.

Essentially, nothing gets fixed or answered about the subject, but I
found it oddly okay. Risky choices were made, humiliation was doled, and
people move on the best they can. As true to reality as it gets I
suppose.

This storyline is becoming real tiresome, but if they want to keep
pushing it, then call it what it is. A dirty old woman looking to
validate herself by nabbing a younger man. To prove to herself she is
still worthy. I mean, that's what women have said about men in the same
situation.

Haven't we also heard for years that actresses who age are aging out of
so many movies (""unfairly"") by comparison to older actors who can still
get great roles.

Hardly. In fact, there are a lot of great roles for older actresses.

But why do so many have to do with this theme of hooking up with a much
younger man.

Surely there are better parts for women out there that have some
substance rather than dummying down to this same old trope.

Let's see some creativity in storytelling. Let's see some storylines
where some of our great, older actresses are cast, but there isn't yet
another young man involved.

We need to see women empowered through their skills and offerings as

There's quite a lot off about this movie, including a lot of tired ideas
the director brought to this project, including reviving the 90s erotic
drama genre, starring an actress approaching 60 but desperately trying
to look and appear younger. That itself would have made an interesting
premise for a film about female vanity and insecurity and the neurotic
need to cling to youth, including an affair with a young lover. Despite

success. Once in a while we see her making sort of brief meeting with
some male supervisor, who sorts of dominates her. She has some sexual
desire she hides. We don't know much about her childhood, besides of
some fast flashbacks. When she has sex, the camera mostly focuses on her
face. From all the people, a young man, who comes as intern, suddenly
understands her better than anyone else's. She develops unusual sexual
connection with him and everything became even more complicated.

It dives into the human mind and how complex, and sometimes impossible,
it is to understand.

It portrays desire and eroticism as an addictive drug that could ruin

Halina Reijn has found the perfect way to begin exploring how pure and
wild our sexuality can be in everyday life, and how essential it is to
eventually accept the truth about who you really are, without caring

65,"Like a lighter take on ""The Piano Teacher""

""Babygirl"" is a psychological thriller that focuses on Romy, the CEO of
an esteemed tech company in New York City. Sexually dissatisfied by her
husband (Antonio Banderas), she finds herself in a complicated sexual
relationship with a younger male intern (Harris Dickinson).

The fourth film by writer-director Halina Reijn, ""Babygirl"" has several
ingredients that make it a fairly compelling watch: Firstly, the
performances. Kidman rarely misses for me, and this is no exception. She
strikes a quiet sort of suffering here as a sexually-frustrated
middle-aged woman working in a highly corporate tech-focused world.
There is a quiet torture she evokes that is palpable, and her
character's cerebral nature is wonderfully offset by her husband's
(played nicely by Banderas), a highly artistic-minded theater director
who in many ways is Romy's polar opposite. Harris Dickinson is also very
good here as Samuel, a wry young intern who attracts Romy through a
series of playful encounters and manipulations.

The film is beautifully shot, with stunning cityscapes and interiors
that are modestly but effectively dressed with Christmas lights and
other holiday decor (parallels to ""Eyes Wide Shut"" were probably
intended, and understandably noted by audiences). The lighting in
particular is beautiful, and the film is underpinned by an ominous
musical score that is effectively used.

All that being said, as I was watching ""Babygirl"", I kept thinking to
myself: ""I've seen something like this before."" It didn't dawn on me
until about midway through that the film felt very much like a less dire
(and frankly much less intense) take on Michael Haneke's ""The Piano
Teacher', a film with a similar setup but different character profiles
and much grimmer circumstances. Like that film, ""Babygirl"" is very much
a meditation on sexual desire and frustration, although it never reaches
a point at which the stakes feel particularly dangerous to us. In that
sense, I think the film falters a bit.

Things do resolve here in a manner that ultimately works and serves the
arc of the story well enough, but I do think it would have been a much
more effective film had the stakes felt less controlled and the
characters more vulnerable. Despite that, though, ""Babygirl"" remains
worthwhile for its accomplished lead performances and dazzling
cinematography. 7/10.",7
66,"Great acting by Kidman & Bandera

While the acting is undoubtedly the film's strongest suit, the story
itself doesn't quite measure up to the performances. ""Babygirl""
ambitiously attempts to weave a narrative about power dynamics, sexual
liberation, and the quest for personal fulfillment, but it occasionally
falters in its execution. The plot, at times, feels like it's treading
familiar territory of the erotic thriller genre without adding much new
to the conversation. There are moments where the film seems to revel
more in its shock value than in pushing the boundaries of storytelling
or character development.

The script struggles with pacing, sometimes rushing through pivotal
character developments or motivations that could have been explored more
thoroughly. This haste can make some plot points feel unearned or
forced, detracting from the overall impact of the narrative. The film's
exploration of Romy's past, her psychological underpinnings, and the
reasons behind her choices are somewhat glossed over, leaving viewers
with questions that could have been answered with a bit more narrative
depth.

Moreover, while the film does an excellent job at showcasing female
desire from a feminist perspective, it doesn't always succeed in
balancing the scales of power and agency among its characters. The
dynamic between Romy and Samuel, while intended to be a dual exploration
of dominance and submission, occasionally tips too far into clichéd
territory, which can feel reductive to the characters' complexities.

Visually, ""Babygirl"" is stunning, with Reijn's directorial style lending
an almost voyeuristic feel to the intimate scenes, juxtaposed against
the cold, sterile environment of corporate America. The cinematography
and use of music are highlights, creating an atmosphere that complements
the film's themes of desire versus control.

In conclusion, ""Babygirl"" is a film that rides high on the strength of
its actors, particularly Nicole Kidman, who delivers a performance
that's both brave and brilliant. While the story itself doesn't reach
the heights set by the acting, the movie still manages to be a
provocative, engaging watch that stimulates thought and conversation
about power, desire, and the masks we wear in our professional and
personal lives. It's a testament to Kidman's craft and a reminder of her
enduring ability to choose roles that challenge and redefine the
expectations of her audience.",6

Babygirl opens with real energy - bold, fresh, and emotionally raw. The

But I have to be honest: halfway through, I started to drift. The pacing
slows down, the tension softens, and some of the momentum from the
beginning starts to fade. I found myself checking the time, waiting for
the story to kick back into gear.

Luckily, it does. The final act brings it all home - intense, emotional,
and totally worth it. The ending hit in a way that reminded me why I

Banderas, understandably looking embarrassed) and two teenage daughters,
of whom one is openly lesbian. It's all improbable and unbelievable.
Writer/director Halina Reijn shows no sign of competence in either
capacity. I felt sorry for the actors. They had no characters to act,
just a lot of symbols and ""types."" Kidman tries to make her role
believable, but not even she can pull this one off. Another movie like

movies with this formula now. It is disturbing. The acting was good and

The movie is exciting at times and manages to tap into female eroticism

appreciate it for existing. However, at times the plot seems a bit
confusing and lines are crossed by the main protagonists that feel wrong
and unsafe, but maybe that was the kind of danger and imperfection that
the makers wanted to explore.

The characters are flawed and the unhinged at times, even makes you
cringe but in real life people are flawed too and can sometime make
reckless choices.

The story left us wanting a bit more. Nicole Kidman is beauty to watch.
Overall an interesting explorative watch for a sunday evening!",7
75,"Not sure what was the point of this movie

I'm being more generous than I probably should with three stars for this
movie, but it's visually pleasing (aside from the weird and cringey sex
scenes), and the acting is very good, as is much of the cinematography.

All that being said... I don't understand why this movie was made or
what it was supposed to be saying, other than that Kidman's character is
a narcissist who needs therapy.

I'm a woman in my 50s, and it's really hard to imagine wanting to have
anything to do with the extremely unappealing character her co-star has
an affair with... especially if you're married to Antonio Banderas? And
I'm not just talking about the fact that Banderas is very attractive and
sexy, but that his character is smart and interesting and kind as well.
So what the actual... is this woman's issue? Again, she seems to need
therapy.

I understand that after 19 years with someone you're not going to find
them hot and sexy most of the time, but it's very hard to imagine a
woman in her position choosing to have an affair with this bland young
man who has no charisma or sex appeal whatsoever. No offense to the
actor as I'm sure he's perfectly sexy in real life, but his character
exudes nothing interesting. If anything, he comes off almost like a meth
head -- I cannot even imagine finding him appealing!

Perhaps the most honest moment is when Kidman's character says to her
husband, ""I'm not normal."" Yep, she's not, and it's a bit excruciating
watching her just be weird for 2 hours.

Also, as a woman in my 50s, and the mother of a twenty-something son,
I'm really getting sick of these May-December movies where middle-aged
women are having affairs with young guys. For the record, I find it
gross the other way around too -- it's just that this particular trend
seems to be catching on more than usual lately. Is this something we're
calling women's empowerment? How about women being empowered to make a
contribution in the world and do amazing things with our power? It feels
like these women are desperate to stay relevant with their bodies and
sex appeal, and I find it incredibly boring, pathetic, and sad.

I realize I sound like a sad, pathetic person myself, but personally, I
just think we woman can do a LOT better than this tripe. Honestly, I
wouldn't have even minded a movie about an affair if it seemed like the
character Kidman chose had a freaking brain or was just totally
irresistible in some way... but essentially the story is all about the
fact that Kidman's character has never had an orgasm with her husband.
Here's an idea for women who want to be empowered: TALK TO YOUR HUSBAND
and get your needs met like an adult.

I realize this review is turning into my social commentary, lol. So back
to a summary of the movie: it's unrealistic, the script is poor, the sex
scenes are cringe, and the music is weird. I feel like the only
realistic thing is how Banderas's character reacts to certain events. It
may be the most redeeming part of the movie. And to be fair, at least
Kidman's character does have the decency to feel remorse, so I guess
there's that.

Overall, though, I genuinely don't understand why the film was made. It
didn't add anything to my understanding of the world. If there was an
important message to be made, I feel like the opportunity was missed.
It's not the worst I've ever seen, but in my opinion it's far from the
best. Your mileage may vary.",3

My Review - Babygirl In Cinemas now My Rating 7/10

Babygirl like The Substance will polarise opinion some will find the
sexual content explicit or embarrassing but after all what is an opinion
worth ?

There are only a handful of actresses today who really step outside
their range to expose themselves entirely emotionally and physically if
they feel the material is warranted they include Cate Blanchett eg Blue
Jasmine 2013 and Carol 2015 ,Carey Mulligan eg Shame 2011 and Saltburn
2023 , and Nicole Kidman in BabyGirl and Eyes Wide Shut in 2019 .

An opinion of a movie or anything else for that matter is just an
individual's subjective view based on their life experience and taste .

Subjective is a term that refers to someone's personal opinions or
feelings regarding a particular subject matter. Subjective views or
opinions are not based on truth or fact. They are one person's unique
interpretation of an idea and their own thoughts, feelings, and
background.

I begin my review of Babygirl with those opening thoughts because in my
opinion unlike The Substance which critics seem to be falling over
backwards to praise Demi Moore propelling her to predicted Oscar glory
is in my opinion a depressing ,embarrassing and tasteless movie.

In contrast I thought Nicole Kidman's portrayal of Romy Mathis a 21st
Century woman ,wife mother and CEO of a huge robotic process automation
company compelling and interesting for a few reasons.

Primarily the interesting concept of Corporate executive power-play
unusually in this instance told from the woman in power's perspective
and not the usual male angle. The story also is about the power of the
object of Romy's desire a young man who is decades younger than his boss
who awakens a sexual desire which leads to a compulsive sexual
relationship with consequences for both parties.

It's difficult to say who grooms who in this interesting and titillating
scenario it's not as obvious as in Fifty Shades of Grey for instance.

In fact I thought this movie could have been a prequel to Christian
Grey's character in that movie?

Romy Mathis is devoted to her family and career yet is dissatisfied with
her absence of sexual gratification with husband, Jacob, a theater
Director played impressively by Antonio Banderas who is surprised to say
the least when Romy suggests they watch pornography while making love.

Romy's fantasy and desire is further triggered by an incident in a
street on her way to work involving a young man and a dog , rest assured
it's not bestiality.

The young man is Samuel played impressively by Harris Dickinson who also
impressed me as Chase Andrews in Where the Crawdads Sing 2022.

In one of those serendipitous coincidences Samuel is later introduced to
CEO Romy as a trainee cadet in her company .

Their mutual attraction is obvious from the start however Romy despite
her desire at first is cool detached and aloof from Samuel's forward and
at times inappropriate comments .However when Samuel chooses Romy as his
mentor their meetings designed to assist Samuel's career transform into
a mutually consensual exploration of hidden passion and desires that
forces Romy literally to her knees .

This is a brave role for Nicole Kidman physically especially her knees
which are not her finest asset. I do admire the way her physicality in
Babygirl is appropriate to her age not filtered out with a Vaseline lens
or use of a younger body double.

It's obvious that Nicole is still a very beautiful woman over 50 who has
taken advantage of modern day cosmetic miracles and a rigorous excercise
and diet regime but still is unafraid to show a wrinkly neck or her
knobbly knees .

It's her performance that impressed me as it was sensitive as well as
provocative she captured the character of a woman who has everything
that modern society covets except the ability to satisfactorily express
her sexuality .

I read that Director and writer of Babygirl Halina Reijn was quoted as
saying that some of the film's intimate scenes were so intense that
Nicole Kidman had to take a break from filming and that an intimacy
co-ordinator was employed on set . That's a new 21st Century movie
credit or role he,she they or them must have really earned their salary
on this movie .

A special mention also to praise the cinematographer Jasper Wolf the
scenes of robotic warehouse marketing and the intimate interior shots
are praise worthy.

Nicole told The Independent, ""There were times when we were shooting
where I was like, 'I don't want to orgasm any more. Don't come near me'
This movie is not for everyone the script has flaws and an improbable
conclusion but it achieved my criteria for a successful move it was
entertaining, very well acted and thought provoking but that's just my
opinion.",7
77,"A Vile and Disgusting Movie

Nicole Kidman has built a storied career of nuanced performances and
fearless choices, but her latest film, Babygirl, is not just a
misstep-it's an outright disgrace. As a woman of Kidman's own age, I've
long admired her ability to navigate Hollywood's often misogynistic
demands with grace and intelligence. However, Babygirl plunges headfirst
into the cesspool of our cultural decay, trading any semblance of
meaningful storytelling for cheap shock value and the crass exploitation
of taboos.

This film is an assault on good taste and decency, a shameless example
of the ""pornification"" of modern media. The plot ostensibly follows
Kidman's character, a middle-aged woman caught in a chaotic downward
spiral involving a much younger man. What could have been a poignant
exploration of age, desire, and power instead devolves into a grotesque
spectacle that revels in shock tactics and depravity. Every scene reeks
of desperation to provoke, reducing the characters to pitiful
caricatures and stripping the story of any emotional depth.

But the content is only part of the problem. What makes Babygirl even
more reprehensible is the way it is packaged and marketed. It drips with
a juvenile obsession with provocation and salaciousness, reveling in its
vulgarity. This isn't art pushing boundaries with purpose or insight;
it's exploitative trash, a film designed to cheapen the conversation
rather than elevate it. The film uses taboo relationships, gratuitous
imagery, and sensational themes as a crutch, substituting titillation
for the nuance and complexity this story could have delivered.

Worse still is the repugnant message the movie sends about women and
aging. Nicole Kidman, an actress whose career has been built on
intelligence and class, is here reduced to a prop in a tawdry spectacle.
At her age-and mine-we deserve stories that reflect our complexities and
lived experiences, not ones that demean us or portray us as pathetic and
desperate in the name of shock value. Watching Babygirl is an exercise
in humiliation for its female audience, and Kidman deserves better.

The film's fixation on the older woman and younger man dynamic is ripe
for thoughtful exploration, but here it's twisted into a grotesque
parody. Instead of offering any meaningful insight, the story becomes a
vehicle for voyeurism. It's an offensive, outdated stereotype that
paints older women as unhinged predators while glorifying the male gaze.
The younger male character is a hollow shell, a lifeless pawn in the
film's quest for provocation. Watching this dynamic play out is
nauseating, a grim reminder of how far we have yet to go in portraying
genuine human relationships onscreen.

Let me be clear: no young man, woman, or girl should see this film.
Babygirl perpetuates the most toxic aspects of our culture, teaching
that shock value is more important than substance, that relationships
are devoid of meaning, and that human connection is just a lurid
spectacle. For a society already drowning in hypersexualized garbage,
Babygirl is gasoline on the fire.

Having spent decades consuming art that takes risks and challenges
societal norms, I know the difference between art that shocks with
purpose and trash that shocks for its own sake. Babygirl is firmly in
the latter camp. True art unsettles us because it reveals something
profound; this film wallows in the gutter, dragging its talented cast
and audience down with it. There's no insight here, only cynicism and
exploitation.

Nicole Kidman's performance is the film's only saving grace, but even
she cannot save this disaster. Her talents are wasted on a character so
poorly written and devoid of purpose that watching her try to inject
life into this role feels painful. The blame lies squarely with a script
and direction that prioritize sleaze over storytelling. Watching Kidman
in this debacle felt like witnessing a master reduced to performing in a
low-budget circus act.

I left the theater not just disappointed but disgusted. This isn't a
film that challenges or enlightens; it degrades and diminishes its
subjects and its viewers. In a world already too eager to objectify and
degrade, Babygirl drags us further into the mire.

If this is the direction cinema is headed, we are in serious trouble. A
film like Babygirl should serve as a wake-up call-not for its content
but for its very existence. We must demand better from our storytellers,
our culture, and ourselves.",1

81,"Good acting and Direction, Could have had a more sophisticated Scenario

Having just watched this film in the cinema, I can say that the plot is
already quite revealed in the trailer. Therefore, I will avoid
discussing it to keep my review spoiler-free. The synopsis is decent-not
particularly new or unique but engaging overall.

I also believe that the director had a clear vision for almost every
scene. Moreover, there are few, if any, redundant scenes.

Nicole Kidman delivers an exceptional performance, as she clearly did
her homework by researching and practicing to accurately convey the
emotions of a woman with BDSM fantasies.

Dickinson also performed well in this relatively challenging role.
However, I believe there is still room for improvement in his
performance. Perhaps this impression stems from the fact that English is
not my first language, but I feel he could enhance his rhetorical
skills.

While I strongly support the movie's portrayal of women in STEM and
powerful women in general, I found Esme's involvement in the story to be
superficial and unrealistic. It didn't feel convincing to me.
Furthermore, I believe the plot could have been more intricate without
altering the core message of the story. As it stands, everything
unfolded too simply.",7
82,Babygirl,7
83,"I quit after 10 minutes

Sometime around the early 70s a movie hit the screens that caused a lot
of hullabaloo. That movie was ""Last Tango in Paris,"" a sort of erotic
thriller as this current movie of Kidman's purports to be. Maybe it was
because that 70s film was early in the exploratory genre of such
movie-making adventures. Maybe because American audiences had not yet
been titillated by something that approached an X-rated movie without
having to enter the sticky floored filth of an actual 1970s X-rated
movie house.

In any case after that 70s film, some filmmakers began to churn out this
erotic thriller genre and audiences responded from two films that
spanned from the mild to the profane in the ""erotic thrilldom."" These
films took audiences on exploitative voyeuristic journeys.

Unfortunately, what is available for contemporary eyes on computers is
so much more advanced than any of those earlier attempts at erotic
thrillers. Now we are left with the ""horses out of the barn."" There
really isn't anything titillating any longer about this genre.

In Aldous Huxley's novel, ""Brave New World,"" at the end of the story,
the protagonist seeks refuge from noisy, pushy crowds that have mentally
tortured him. He goes to an isolated environment, but those crowds seek
him out. They taunt him, begging him to whip himself as they had seen
him do in an earlier chapter. ""Use the whip! Use the whip"" they cry.
These people, you see, have no ability to feel authentic emotions.

I'm thinking about that Huxley novel with the 10 minutes that I watched
of this movie. It says, those people today have no ability to feel
authentic emotions. To feel compassion for another being. To recognize
in another person, all the fraility, all the hurts that make us
vulnerable and be our authentic self with some other person. That takes
true intimacy. Everything else is fluff and play acting. Just like
Kidman's character's husband plays with dramatic arts in his field of
work, she plays with dramatic arts in her romantic, faithlessness. But
truly, there is no depth here. There is no morality that any viewer can
leave with and say, ""Gee, I would like something like that in my life.""

The film is voyeuristic garbage. Avoid it..",2

historical wounds of complex personalities. Movie shows how present

down for the sanity and serenity of a home. Though the fantasies were
magnified for dramatic reasons, Nicole Kidman's flawless acting made
them look menacingly realistic. Great cinematography and visuals.

especially with his cruel behavior. Had he been a dynamic character the
movie may have been pretty good but this was a huge fail! Nicole Kidman
did the best she could with what she had to work with. And I continue to
respect her immensely for refusing to show full-on nudity. This was done
in a classy way. But pretty bad movie. There are so many young,
attractive men with plenty of sex appeal to make the attraction
believable but Dickenson is NOT that person!",2
88,"Babygirl (2024) is an intense, visually stunning thriller

I recently watched Babygirl, and I must say, it's one of the most unique
and daring thrillers I've seen in a while. Directed by Halina Reijn, the
film dives deep into the complexities of human desire and power
dynamics, wrapped in an intense, almost suffocating atmosphere.

First off, the visuals are stunning. The cinematography by Jasper Wolf
captures the raw emotion of each scene, blending light and shadow to
create a moody, almost dreamlike world. There's a constant feeling of
tension, as if something explosive is always on the verge of happening,
and the pacing keeps you on edge throughout.

Nicole Kidman delivers an amazing performance, bringing a mix of
vulnerability and cold calculation to her character. The supporting
cast, though lesser-known, does a great job too, giving the story depth
and unpredictability. Without giving too much away, the film's
exploration of psychological control and submission feels both
disturbing and mesmerizing.

That said, Babygirl is not for everyone. Its erotic elements are
tastefully done but can feel uncomfortable or controversial for some
viewers. The storyline at times feels intentionally vague, forcing you
to piece together the characters' motivations, which I found intriguing
but might frustrate others.

Overall, if you're into psychological thrillers that don't shy away from
taboo subjects and push the envelope, Babygirl is definitely worth the
watch. It's haunting, stylish, and will leave you thinking about it long
after the credits roll.",8

felt her emotions. But the way Harris played his character was just
CRAZY. He showed us a man, confused in his sense of intimacy and love,

There is something odd and unique about Nicole Kidman doing risqué

young boys is getting repetitive - yet this one is a bit more 9 1/2
weeks with some unique themes borderline soft porn for most viewers but
there is some tidbits of healthy/ unhealthy pseudo sexual modern
exploration.

The acting is decent by Kidman and Banderas but the young kid was not
very convincing and needs to learn some better erotic dance moves.

The plot and theme was hard to find believable and the boy kid could
easily have involved an older hunk or a sex therapist closer to Kidman
age to provide more depth and meaning - instead we are led to believe
that a juvenile kid /intern 20s has mastered the power/ domination
expertise without much explanation or character development besides
knowing how to control a powerful old women like a dog.

Is this really the new stage for power Feminism is woman of power need
young boys to dominate them. ??

A sad commentary on modern feminism yet the kink and sex themes are a
unique modern perspective that most might equate with soft porn
exploitation rather than a deeper individual sexual and childhood
exploration/ neurosis.

Regardless it is a rather bold and complex issue to explore in modern
cinema perhaps a bit too avant garde and kudos to the writer/ director
to get Kidman and Banderas to participate.

The ending is a bit tame and lame yet it tries to bring a safe
resolution to a very complex issue that basically is sending out a
message that a power CEO cheating on her husband is somehow acceptable

A fascinating sexual thriller of recent years, it attracts attention
with its unique love dynamics: the woman is older than the man by as

cinema, such a couple seems rare, because more often than not, it is the
man who turns out to be older. Kidman did a great job with the role, as
did Dickinson, who had a chance to shine in ""Triangle of Sadness"". The
love scenes are truly impressive, but I would like more variety and more
candid moments. The music and many dance scenes give the film a special
piquancy, creating an atmosphere of intriguing attraction. Overall, I

acting saved it from triviality. Nicole Kidman was great and it was
surely a brave move for her to play that role the way she did. She
didn't only strip off physically but also emotionally. A good
performance. Harris Dickinson was okay but sometimes a bit too pale
especially when he tried to do the emotional stuff. But he was good at
being a seducer, that part worked very well. Antonio Banderas also had
some absolutely great moments in the film and I felt his performance was

that run counter to their mainstream life.

The director, be she gay or not, is, among other things, a therapist,
which is probably why the acting is first rate but there is also a lot
of talk and role playing. The only nudity is from Kidman that seems
rather strange and the whole thing has a sell out twist that makes it
all very safe. By that I mean that Kidman's character runs a corporation
yet is sexually unfufilled despite what seems a happy marriage and
kids--one of whom is either gay or trans--possibly. So the story concept
seems to be teasing the idea of does this powerful woman secretly want
to be helpless in order to be sexually happy? An edgy topic for sure.

The bulk of the movie, too much, are the sex scenes though mostly it's
about her being told to do things, like drink milk from a cat bowl. The
movie wallows in this stuff, perhaps fan of submission will enjoy it on
that level, why not? But the story, especially the ending, doesn't come
off in any kind of supportive or sympathetic way. As can be the case
this movie settles for a women good, men bad ending, leaving behind some
interesting and challenging elements along the way. And it's a long way,
there is little plot and the ending when it finally comes is rather
rushed.

Kidman is well cast and all the actors make the material more
interesting, if ultimately not compelling, for longer than would be
possible. Banderas as her husbands role should realy be larger.

Another thing is a fair amount of wealth porn, both Kidman and Bandaras
are super rich. This fights against some connection the audience could
have for them, but instead you'll find yourself saying, ""Wow, nice Pool.
Wow, nice office. Wow, he's a broadway play director. Wow nice wardrobe!

Interesting use of music and songs which is very loud and starts and
stops abruptly. A lot of shallow focus, the opening shot is effective
and unusual, but this lack of focus is distracting as it goes on, having
things pull in and out of focus, there are moments where one eye is in
focus and not the other, it's just not very well shot and feels a bit
like video. Kidman sometimes looks great and sometimes aging, which if
controlled could fit into the story very neatly, but it seems more an
accident of how it was lit and shot, not intent.

So again, this is NOT A THRILLER. It's slightly highminded arthouse
sexploitation film, if that's what you're looking for you'll find this
most satisfying.",5

102,"Compelling But Not As Complex As It Tries To Be

Babygirl ends up feeling like a bit less than the sum of its parts but a
compelling experience of a movie nonetheless that I can honestly say I
was never bored by. It was definitely an interesting film to see in
theatre given the content and the amount of moments that feel reaction
worthy and I think that definitely added to the overall experience.

Nicole Kidman gives a performance I would honestly describe as fearless
and I think it's her work that kept me as engaged as I was throughout.
It's a very multi faceted character that has quite a few traits that in
the hands of a lesser performer could've come across as conflicting. She
really is a legend for a reason and seeing her take swings like this at
this stage of her career is something I find very gratifying. Harris
Dickinson I thought was fine but I don't know that I got quite as much
out of that character as I wanted to. It's the type of character where
you have to feel a certain allure about right away but in my case I just
didn't really see it. Maybe that's because he just comes across as such
a strange person from his very first scenes. But I think a large part of
that comes down to the writing however and in how it portrays this
central relationship.

There's a line by Dickinson about 40 minutes in; ""I make one phone call
and you lose everything"" but it didn't really ring true to me at all. It
feels as if she's doing everything she can to spurn his advances up till
then and as soon as things actually start to heat up the film becomes
pretty montage heavy in a way that just feels as if it's rushing through
the progression of their dynamic. We certainly don't see erotic
thrillers at this level as much as we once did but I wouldn't really say
the film did much to put its own spin on the genre. The script didn't
ultimately go anywhere that I didn't expect it to and as a result there
weren't really any surprises for me. I think that's particularly
disappointing given the fact that I thought Halina Reijn's last film,
Bodies Bodies Bodies, felt like a very unique approach to the whodunnit
genre but that voice didn't really carry over to this film.

I also really did not care for the way the film was edited. It was
sloppily put together in places particularly in how it transitions
between scenes. They really end up feeling abruptly ended in ways that
gave me whiplash and a lot of moments feel awkwardly inserted into
overall narrative. That doesn't take away from the fact that it looks
absolutely gorgeous with a really colourful look and I ended up really
appreciating the Christmas vibe that the whole thing has. Halina Reijn
directs a lot of these scenes in a way that feels very intrusive that
works particularly well in the more intimate scenes. You end up feeling
like a fly on the wall in this sequences and the moments that made me
cringe felt totally purposeful.

Babygirl isn't quite as tight as I would've liked and it doesn't end up
feeling all that original but I have to be fair and say that I was never
not interested by it. It's got a central performance that's awe
inspiring to watch and I do think that I was feeling a lot of what I was
supposed to but I just wish the actual script was better. It's a solidly
done version of a movie we've seen before and suppose I just wanted a
little bit more out of it than that.",7
103,"Absolutely Not

This movie was so bad. I have never been blue-balled harder in my life.
They advertised this film as a kinky, age gap, romantic thriller. None
of that is true.

Every time I thought Sam and Romy were about to have a steamy scene...
cut to nothing. There was so much potential with the story and the setup
and I'm very disappointed with the execution. The ""After"" movie series
had better erotic scenes than this. Also, the slander of older women in
this film was bad, they kept pointing out how old Romy was as if a major
point wasn't the fact that she was older than Sam.

The music choice was also interesting because they kept using the same
song to add suspense that built to nothing, they did not explore the
kinky side of their relationship as much as they should have. Another
thing, Romy's back story of growing up in a cult and coming out as a
boss woman CEO is not made a big deal like it should be.

This movie is not empowering to women's sexuality at all. Period.",2

107,"High Wire Act

""Babygirl"" is an extraordinary movie, all about the search for meaning,
and the extension of compassion. The acting is jawdropping throughout,
and especially in the scenes between Nicole Kidman and Harris
Dickinson-such listening, sense of play, bravery. Every scene between
them is a high wire act, and it's all about compassion and tenderness.
Nicole Kidman's character doesn't know this is what she will find as she
enters a dom/sub relationship with a younger man, but that is the case.

The movie is full of messy human emotion, of mistakes and regrets, but
everything that happens needs to happen for everyone to grow, and for
the central marriage to survive. All the components, including the
relationship with Kidman's protegée and her older daughter are carefully
placed pieces of the story, and the writer/director understands what
she's doing at all times.

This movie is the antidote to the ""50 Shades"" movies. It is all about
how our desires cannot be ignored, and that only in facing them and
accepting them can individuals and relationships be healed.",8

I can't recommend this movie. Everything; the plot, the dialouge, the

characters lacked depth and the actor they chose for the male intern did
not make sense and was not believable. There was zero plot, way too many
regurgitated sex scenes that really just left people feeling
uncomfortable. Not even Nicole can carry this movie and its definately
not her best work. Most of it needs to be on the cutting room floor and
shot again. Some of the main characters reactions to things going on
around them weren;t credible, Even Nicole's representation of a powerful

As you might have have already guessed there is no other roast in the
story. So what do our ""Babygirl"" creators do? They serve the cold, hairy

Someone needs to tell them that borrowing someone else's movies to make

Babygirl is a bit messy, yet it's sexy nature, character dynamics,

Halina Reijn's direction remains strong on capturing the essence of it's
setting and nature. Powered with interesting themes and character
dynamics between each other. Alongside with good production designs and
camerawork. Narrative wise, the story is a bit predictable. Because
stories like this aren't new and it did drag some moments and my
connection with the characters aren't fully invested as I would have
hoped for. But I do appreciate some of the new concepts and ideas it did
explore. The ideas of hypocrisy and double standard are explored
solidly.

Overall, it seems A24 is going for more popular standard concepts
recently which I am happy for them being able to spread out for wider
audiences. I recommend this for a good erotic thriller, just not
something that I say is amazing.",6

A pretty good movie. It keeps you engaged and on your toes. The only
thing that needs some work is more chemistry between Romy and Samuel,
and also more sex scenes! I mean the movie had a pretty good amount of
raunchy scenes, but I felt it wasn't raunchy enough. Too much foreplay
and building the tension without enough climax between the two main
characters. The acting was good and the storyline was also good. Not a
lot of heavy bdsm stuff in this movie, it's pretty light play but that
didn't stop me from enjoying the movie. I also wish they took the

have heard ""I don't know"" more than 30 times and ""I 'm ok"" more than 50
times. I could never imagine that an talented mature actress such as
Nicol Kidman would ever play in such a movie. As CEO in a company of no
goal, no role, no message, NK acting was a tragedy. Unmatching
characters, predictable behaviors and scenes out of nowhere. Antonio

undistinguished albeit well made time passer. The real plus here is a
great performance from Harris Dickinson, surely one of today's most
underrated actors. He always chooses otherwise interesting projects,

119,"Erotic, Psychological Thriller

Babygirl is a thought-provoking, erotic, psychological thriller.

The whole story is a character study and I realised that near the end of
the film. Both leading characters are very complex. I still wonder
whether Romy wanted it or not. There are also great moments, for example
in Romy's eyes Isabel's actions with the girl next door verified her
own. It was a little frustrating when I realised that none of the
characters make good decisions when needed, but that's also very
realistic. On the other hand I couldn't feel connected to any of the
characters except for Jacob, but the movie doesn't focus on him too
much. So wasn't too intrigued throughout the whole film.

The cinematography is great, I loved the longshots, but it's not the way
of filming that is outstanding, but the acting performances. Both Nicole
Kidman and Harris Dickinson are amazing. In the beginning there was a
little use of CGI which was terrible in my opinion. The score and
soundtrack on the other hand is extremely powerful and my favourite
aspect of the film. The cast is great, I didn't know some of the actors
involved, so I was surprised to see Esther-Rose McGregor after seeing
her in Obi-Wan Kenobi a few years ago.

it's not outstanding.",7

of a woman overwhelmed by pressure, responsibility, power hence
perversions.

And then there's Samuel, this ""bestial"" hot young guy willing to play
the game in a very realistic, convincing, ""turn on"" way.

blockbuster's movies, and when compelling and disagreeable characters
are made human and relatable like Nicole Kidman does, one just can say,

I'm going to be honest. For the first time in over 20 years I left

wanted to know who she was that led her to where she is now. Nothing
except flash backs to a cult. It could have been so much better. I liked
the premise of the film. An overachieving CEO woman who likes to be
dominated in the bedroom. I guess it was supposed to be 50 shades of
grey with a high power female with a younger male intern. Dynamics
differ because she could loose her marriage and business. Acting was
good. Nicole is beautiful. I will probably finish the film when it comes
out on prime but don't waste your money.",1
124,"Working Girl

Babygirl opens with Nicole Kidman and husband Antonio Banderas having
the kind of passionate, intimate sex you see in Hollywood movies. When
they are done, Kidman quickly scampers off to another room to enjoy some
pornography. Hollywood sex you see, often doesn't cut it in the real
world. And that's really the crux of writer/director Halina Reijn's
latest film, even ideal isn't good enough if you aren't being honest
with yourself.

Kidman plays Romy Mathis, a tech company CEO with a charming and
handsome theatre director husband (Banderas), a seemingly good
relationship with her two children and at least two palatial homes. She
has accomplished the ""have it all"" life women are told to aspire to and
works hard to keep it, striving to be the best at her job, undertaking a
painstaking (and painful looking) beauty routine including such delights
as numbing free botox and ice baths and attempts to be the ideal loving
and supportive wife. The problem is, she isn't satisfied in the bedroom,
longing for something a bit more out there than her gentleman husband is
comfortable with (for a creative type he is a bit of a square). Enter
tall drink of water Harris Dickinson as young intern Samuel. He first
catches her attention in the street when he calmly brings an out of
control dog to heel and when they later meet at work it turns out he has
an intuition for seeing what people need and quickly spots Romy is
desperate for somebody to call the shots over her. She makes half
hearted attempts to quell his directness but the pair soon end up in a
master/slave style sexual relationship with the fact she is risking both
career and family only fuelling Romy's desire. The central affair may
have been billed as steamy, erotic thriller fodder, and at times it is,
but it also has painfully awkward moments as the pair navigate their
situation and find their roles. One scene involving milk will bring back
nightmares to UK viewers who remember an infamous episode of Celebrity
Big Brother.

The best thing about Babygirl is that it isn't a film that sets out to
judge or punish its lead character for having sexual desire. There is a
worrying mention early on of Romy having been raised in some sort of
cult but the film settles on her desire to get freaky being part of her
natural character rather than a character flaw. The moral dilemma is in
her actions, not her wants. Embarking on an affair behind your partners
back is one thing and the power dynamic between Kidman and Dickinson is
interesting (and certainly not something that would have worked were the
genders reversed). She is his superior snd supposed mentor but in many
ways the power rests with him as he can, as he says, ""end her with a
phone call"". More grey area is added by Dickinson's enigmatic portrayal
of Samuel, there is no doubt he is one hundred percent complicate in the
relationship, the instigator in fact, but it is mostly unclear how much
his child like outbursts are part of a controlling game and how much he
is just not emotionally equipped for the situation.

It feels a bit redundant to say Nicole Kidman is good but she really
locks down a challenging role. For a film of this type it's low on
nudity but high on emotional vulnerability and she deftly avoids the
trap of making Romy a Jekyll and Hyde character with two separate
personalities. There is enough fragility in her polished CEO mode that
we can see she needs something more and enough steel to let us know that
she put herself in her predicament willingly. Both Dickinson and
Banderas are also great and there is a low key fantastic performance
from Sophie Wilde as Kidman's subtly frustrated assistant, tired of not
get her due and her boss's lack of action on improving things for women
in the workplace.

The films weaknesses are mostly related to the story telling. It was
obviously never going to be a plot heavy film; you know two people are
going to meet, embark on an affair and eventually there will be some
sort of reckoning. There's no problem with that but a couple of things
don't quite ring true. For instance, Romy is taken aback by the way
Samuel begins challenging her at work when surely slapping down cocky
young men at work is part and parcel of daily working life for women in
positions of power. The timeline is also a little confusing, with
birthday parties, fallings out and montages it feels like a fair bit of
time passes yet the decorated trees suggest the entire film takes place
in the run up to Christmas.

Ultimately, your milage with Babygirl with depend on your ability to get
on board with the main character's inner struggle. On the one hand, it's
a film about a one percenter who takes advantage of her position of
power to cheat on a loving husband rather than just tell him to get a
little nasty between the sheets. On the other, its the story of a women
who has done everything right but is still not whole because society has
told her that being herself is in someway shameful and the damage that
can do to a persons life. Or you can just pretend you are watching an
after hours Hallmark movie.

126,"Kidman Bares Soul (and Body Parts) In a Bold, Ironic, Thoughtful Film

Halina Reijn is a well-regarded Dutch actress. Since her debut as a
writer/director with the film ""Instinct"" (2019), she's shown some deft
skill on the other side of the camera. ""Instinct"" centers on an affair
between an experienced psychologist and a serial rapist being considered
for release from prison. The film explores feminism, sex and power.
""Babygirl"" revisits these same topics.

Romy (Nicole Kidman) is the CEO of a robotics company in NYC. She's
tightly controlled, perhaps even a little obsessive. (She puts
handwritten notes in her kids' knapsacks.) Romy goes to therapy, gets
regular botox injections and engages in a wide variety of other
activities in a futile effort to control her appearance, her feelings
and everything else around her. Into her life saunters Samuel (Harris
Dickinson - ""Triangle of Sadness""), an intern at the company. Romy
becomes his mentor. Right. During their initial ten-minute meet and
greet, Samuel blurts out ""I think you like to be told what to do."" He's
mortified. She's flustered and thrilled. Soon enough, they begin an
affair. He revels in telling his boss what to do. She enjoys being told.
What's fascinating about their interactions is the raw nature of it all.
Both are responding to feelings, intuitions and urges they don't fully
understand. Samuel's ""commanding"" presence is actually riddled with
self-doubt. At one point, he says, ""I scare myself sometimes."" Romy,
too, is chock-full of contradictions. She's a powerful female CEO in a
male-dominated field who's terrified to ask for what she really wants.

Expect both Kidman and Dickinson to be in several awards conversations.
Kidman is arguably the most courageous A-lister working today. She's
fearless about baring her soul - or her body parts. (Check out TV's ""Big
Little Lies"" and ""The Perfect Couple,"" the films ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" ""Dead
Calm,"" ""To Die For"" - you'll get the idea.) Here, the immersion of both
actors in these challenging roles is enough to make this project
must-see viewing.

This film is occasionally uncomfortable, frequently disconcerting and
consistently complex. In interviews, Reijn has expressed her admiration
for ""9 ½ Weeks,"" ""Fatal Attraction,"" ""Secretary"" and the work of Dutch
director Paul Verhoeven (""Showgirls,"" ""Basic Instinct""). However, her
appreciation doesn't stop her from turning the erotic thriller genre on
its head. In ""Babygirl,"" the power figure is obviously female. The
ambivalence and self-doubt of her two main characters undermines the
stereotype of the always-confident man in charge. At one point, Romy
blurts out that she has not had an orgasm in 25 years of marriage. Her
husband, Jacob, is played by heartthrob Antonio Banderas. Jacobs works
in theater. Currently, he's directing ""Hedda Gabler,"" Henrik Ibsen's
play about a woman constrained by society and trapped in a loveless
marriage. Clearly, Reijn has taken great delight in crafting a world
filled with so many ironies and contradictions.

""Babygirl"" develops several provocative ideas. The film implies that sex
is the area of life where we are all most prone to embarrassment and
self-doubt - and least likely to say what we want. It also suggests that
sex is the human activity most consistently associated with confusion
and shame. In addition, Writer/Director Reijn takes a few jabs at
conventional female empowerment. At one point, a subordinate looks at
Romy accusingly and says, ""I genuinely believed women with power would
behave differently.""

""Babygirl"" is a film that asks a lot of questions without offering many
answers. If you need a film that makes decisive statements about the
human condition, this isn't for you. It's a film that's unapologetically
raw and messy (read ""European""). But if you're open to playful
ambiguity, provocation and a bracing dose of confusion, this film is
well worth your time.",7

runs rampant in this movie. Perhaps in a half-hearted attempt to explore
the contradictions of the female psyche. Even if so, the film remains

I had heard this film was terrible so I went in expecting very little

so misses the point. It's a human story of flawed humans, their desires
(not yours) and the risks they take as well as the sacrifices they make
(this woman was having unfulfilling sex for decades and we know that's
not news). The Harris Dickinson character is immature and nervous (and
perfectly dressed in sweats, rucksack and ill-fitting suits), trying to
find his way - those who thought he was arrogant and unbelievable must
have had a layer missing. Nicole's character is a stereotype, sure, but
so what? I found her portrayal of a sexually frustrated wife and mother
to be realistic, the complexities of power in the workplace, especially
with her assistant, also pretty true to life.

All the way through, I empathised with her and the state one gets in
when consumed by desire... the guy is so young, he IS cocky but that's
literally the ignorance of youth - that veil comes down in private
moments. To make a movie about a high powered woman who risks it all for
an affair with a young man is fraught with risks and cliches but I

I intentionally avoid all trailers and go into movies knowing as little
as possible. This is an example of when that mostly beneficial strategy
backfires. I would never have chosen a movie made for bored and
unfulfilled wives, where the main draw is the ""thrill of the wrong.""

With some decent filmmaking aspects, good performances, and a meager
attempt at being artistic, it's not as atrocious as Fifty Shades of
Grey. But the end result is the same, a trashy waste of time. It's
extremely boring and useless, never amounting to anything or going in
any interesting directions.

Certain aspects of this movie remind me of another 2024 release, The
Substance. It also stars an aging actress with themes of trying to stay
young, explicit scenes, and attempts at being artistic. But the
difference couldn't be more drastic. The Substance succeeds at
entertaining you, shocking you, and creating a memorable piece of art.
Whereas Babygirl is just low class smut.

Most men that want to see this movie will only be interested in about 5
minutes of onscreen sex and nudity. Let's not lie to ourselves. Although
there is a feature length movie with a plot, a storyline and a moral,
millions of Nicole Kidman fans don't care. They care about seeing Nicole
Kidman. But buyer beware, this is not the same Kidman what we have been
seeing since the late 1980s. She is older now, in her 50's, and yet she
is still drop dead gorgeous, she is not just entertaining her audience
like before. Granted, she will entertain and not let down the millions
of ""men"" that want to see her cinematic beauty. Then again, she did not
star in this movie to entertain any man. In fact, this is a movie for
anyone woman over the age of 40. For those who have criticized or
reviewed this movie that is male or was born after George Bush Sr. Left
office, you have no business judging this movie.

This is a ladies only, boys not allowed club house. The point of this
movie was to showcase a woman who is no longer in her prime, no longer
young or attractive to most men. Although she is still breathtaking, it
is obvious she is no longer a teenager. Still, Nicole gives a truthful
performance as a woman who wants to feel like she once did. The sex
scenes scream a vulnerability that Kidman has displayed before. This is
not soft core or anything exploitative because the subject matter at
hand is pure.

A good movie that will attract two opposite audiences with different
reasons why they are buying a ticket. In the end, both these types of
viewers will get what they paid for. A connection of vulnerability and
worth in the eyes of every woman has every felt the pain of time and the
irresistible eye candy of Nicole Kidman which will never get old.",7

137,"This movie remind me of The Piano Teacher

Babygirl was a new erotic thriller about a middle age women who having,

Dutch female filmmaker, but set in the United States, I love this film
due to the film was an erotic thriller, and remind me of The Piano
Teacher, a 2001 film that have a similar narrative to Babygirl, I love
this film and it sexy, Nicole Kidman performance remind me of Isabelle

a wife who was a Hispanic man and have a two daughter, but nevertheless
I recommend to watch this film, very sexy.",7
138,"Boring, Just So Dull

There was no chemistry between Kidman and Dickinson and her being
submissive to him was tedious with nary a spark between them.

My mind wandered after the first 10 minutes: Should I turn this off? She
really needs a moisturizer; her mouth can't close; is that a Natori
chemise? Eeuw, her mouth can't close and her tongue is reptilian; tick
the box, daughter is gay; no woman would wipe her mouth with the back of
her hand; that's a pretty throw; her makeup is really bad; I really like
that cream sofa- Room and Board?

The only person with evidence that warm blood pumps through his veins is
Banderas. I hope he got paid a lot of money to be in this distinctly
unsexy, boring film. He had to work for it.",4
139,"Good movie, over aggressive hate comments

The movie was good at conveying their point about the consequences of
repressed desires and how shame and social expectations can cause it
especially in older women who have been socialized to be that way. I
loved it and the message that it was conveying. I have gone to watch
this movie more times than I would like to admit and have loved even
more each time. The plot is CLEAR and OBVIOUS you just have to pay
attention to get it and if you don't have the attention span for a two
hour movie don't watch. The writer-director Halina Reijn said that this
movie was like a response to Eyes Wide Shut and she was right. The main
difference is that IN MY OPINION Babygirl is 1000% better. Were there
parts that I wished could have been fleshed out more? Yes, but it is an
A24 movie so they had to work within the budget. While the movie is
about sex and desire it wasn't as nearly pornographic as Eyes Wide Shut
(which Halina said was on purpose). Also it's not really a D/s movie
like 50 Shades of Grey or Secretary and IT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO BE so
tailor your expectations. This movie STARTS the conversation about the
orgasm gap. It was EXTREMELY CLEAR in the TRAILER AND THE DESCRIPTION
that Nicole's character was going to be having an affair with her intern
so if you have a problem with movie characters cheating don't watch.
Halina has described the film as a cautionary tale on what NOT TO DO so
you don't follow Romy's mistakes but that she is not a writer/director
that wants to punish her leads. So many people are review bombing this
movie for no actual genuine reason if you read the comments. You can
tell they were barely watching or making superficial comments about
Nicole's face (which is literally apart of the freaking plot). The movie
is awkward on purpose. It's intentionally meant to have cringey moments
because neither character knows what they're doing since they have never
explored/acted on the desires portrayed in the film. It's a good film
for what it is, trying to over compare and over associate it to films
that have a similar premise does it a disservice and takes away from the
messaging as a whole. After all the GLARING taglines and warnings about
what the movie was about when it was being promoted and if the concept
doesn't interest you and I cannot stress this enough don't watch it and
don't hate watch it. It's not meant for you and that's okay.",10
140,"Wish it was more like a real thriller

Babygirl is written and directed by Halina Reijn. This is Halina Reijn's
third directorial venture, Babygirl, sees her once again step behind the
camera, bringing an ambitious psychological drama to life. Starring
Nicole Kidman as Romy, alongside Harris Dickinson as Samuel and Antonio
Banderas, the film delves into themes of self-image, power, and
psychological manipulation. While the setup hints at a strong
female-driven narrative, Babygirl struggles to find its footing, falling
short of its potential as a gripping thriller.

The opening act establishes Romy as an enigmatic, highly accomplished
woman grappling with her own inner demons. Nicole Kidman delivers a
nuanced performance, perfectly embodying Romy's external perfection and
internal conflict. However, this initial exploration feels overly drawn
out, leaning heavily on exposition rather than action. While it provides
a foundation for Romy's character, the pacing falters, making it
difficult to stay engaged.

The middle section aims to build the relationship between Romy and
Samuel, her younger and seemingly manipulative partner. Harris Dickinson
portrays Samuel with an unsettling charm, and the pair's mind games add
intrigue but fail to sustain momentum. The film repeatedly falls back on
surface-level provocations, particularly sexual tension, which feels
excessive rather than illuminating.

Finally, the last act delivers the tension promised by the film's
premise, albeit not entirely in the way one might hope. The stakes rise
on a personal level for Romy, and Reijn successfully heightens the
emotional intensity. However, the lack of focus on her professional
life-hinted as a critical aspect of her identity-undermines the broader
tension. The corporate drama, which could have provided another
dimension of stakes and conflict, is conspicuously absent.

In conclusion, Babygirl is a film that may appeal to those seeking a
slow-burn psychological character study. However, viewers expecting an
intense, tightly-knit thriller with far-reaching consequences may walk
away disappointed.",6
141,"Quite flashy, painfully stupid, truly empty and incredibly tedious

This is simply another bright candy wrapper from A24, like far too much
of their output. Consequently, you have the crisp, high-definition
shots, some interesting scene transitions, consistently annoying and
repetitive soundtrack choices with sound mixing insistent on making that
music far too loud (curse Nolan for making it ""cool"" with Interstellar)
and a gnawing void at its core.

I think this was MEANT to be a narrative of Kidman's uptight,
controlling CEO having her desire for submissiveness unlocked by
Dickinson's intern and ultimately reigniting passion for life. The
problem here is that she NEVER actually seems in control of ANYTHING. In
a performance reminiscent of a similarly trash character from Jurassic
World, Kidman's character is basically always apologetic, always giving
in to people who are supposedly her inferiors at work after only token
protest and unable to exercise any power in her family either. We are
meant to believe an underling could just write a CEO into a mentorship
program without her knowledge and she would simply shrug and accept,
rather than cancelling the thing and kicking the underling out
immediately? Her company is meant to be in the business of coldly
eliminating countless warehouse jobs through automation; yet she never,
ever evidences the cold grip one would have to have to go through with
that.

Likewise, Dickinson's character just comes across as a dead-eyed creep
to me. It's hilarious that he is simultaneously a former dog trainer, an
intern at this high-powered company doing....something (he is literally
NEVER shown with any kind of a responsibility) and also a bartender in
time outside of the internship (one would think being a certified dog
trainer would pay far more than bartending and obviate the need for it,
but what do I know?) That he is also able to juggle all that and also
not one but multiple relationships without looking dead tired all the
time is even funnier. Nothing about his performance makes it convincing
how he is able to get away with repeatedly undermining his CEO from the
very start - nor what actually makes him so attractive to some three
women across the narrative. The way his character is written comes
across like textbook PUA wish fulfilment; the fact this thing was
directed by a woman might be the strongest evidence ever that some women
do find the whole ""negging"" mess attractive.

Beyond that, the film does grasp at a few other topics (AI! Kidman's
husband stage theater! Their elder daughter being an unfaithful
lesbian!) but has nothing meaningful to say about any of it. The
dialogue in general is remarkably bad, to the point so many
conversations are just tiresome. I was bored and hoping for it to be
over even before the halfway mark - hardly a good sign for anything, but
especially damning for a supposed erotic thriller. It's funny how the
most obvious explanation for Dickinson's transparently gaslighting act -
that he is simply aiming to sleep his way to the top - is not even
considered by anyone in the company, and the whole thing chooses to end
with a literal whimper.",3
142,"Pretty Good Movie

Rating - 7.0: Overall, a pretty good movie that is carried by its
aesthetic and Nicole Kidman's performance, but it is held back by its
lackluster writing.

Direction - Pretty Good: The direction on a macroscale is pretty good as
they created an aesthetic that really suited the movie; The direction on
a microscale is pretty good as they used tension and cringe to really
heighten the scandal and power dynamic between the two; The storytelling
is pretty simple; They use tension very well as the movie uses this to
make the moments between the two leads uncomfortable; The movie is very
much told from the female perspective and the director does a good job
showing this

Story - Decent: The concept is interesting, but the story itself is
pretty bland and predictable; The plot structure is very simple;
Character writing is good, as you get a sense of how Romy's personal
struggles and power dynamic are influencing her decisions, and Samuel's
mystery helps make this an intriguing relationship for Romy

Screenplay - Decent to Pretty Good: The dialogue is sound but feels a
little too Gen Z; the humor is decent; the symbolism is profound as the
movie tackles issues with power dynamics, women in power, and sexual
fantasies; the foreshadowing is not good as events toward the end just
happen because that is what you expect

Acting - Pretty Good: Nicole Kidman - Good to Very Good (A very
vulnerable performance as she shows why she is one of the best in
Hollywood; She shows a wide range of emotions; She has pretty good
chemistry with Dickinson), Harris Dickinson - Pretty Good to Good (He
does the best with what is written for the character as his charisma
suits the role; He has pretty good chemistry with Nicole Kidman), Sophie
Wilde - Decent to Pretty Good (Plays the assistant character well and
has decent chemistry with Kidman), Antonio Banderas - Pretty Good (An
experienced actor who gets his moments to show his work but is not
really given that much screen time), Rest of the cast - Decent to Pretty
Good (More about the main cast, but the remaining cast does well in
supporting roles)

Score - Pretty Good: Helps establish the tone and aesthetic of the
movie;

Cinematography - Good: Really enjoyed the cinematography as it gave it
an aesthetic that really fit the hustling nature of the New York
business world; Really enjoyed how they used the glass reflection as
somewhat of a mirror

Editing - Good: The movie felt well-edited, especially toward the end

Pacing - Pacing is a little all over the place because it seems slow in
many moments, yet they just speed through plot points in other moments;
The passage of time is not really clear, so you have no idea what the
time period is

Climax - Climax is all right but not really the best in execution;

Tone - Tone is very much an erotic thriller;

Final Notes - I liked the aesthetic of the movie more than the actual
story;",7
143,"Baby boy, you stay on my mind, fulfill my fantasies...

There is something very unfulfilling in this movie. But it is still
good. It dances around the middle, to become a hybrid creature, that is
not going all the way, when it is aiming to go all the way. It trying to
be subversive, but the feeling that we get give the impression that it
tries too much to be something that it isn't.

The movie holds back though it tries to be boundaryless and blunt. At
the end and in the beginning it is suffering from a feeling, that this
film wants to be somewhere in the Indy areas and boundaries, but it is
too polished and not enough rough on the edges, to give the feeling that
we are watching a unique voice.

The ones who didn't see the trailer might miss the direction for, maybe,
ten minutes. It starts with a climax, that turns out to be fake and the
road to a secret affair becomes very short and predictable. When you've
got it all and you are a (very very) successful woman, you probably are
going to be the one that might hurt yourself, eventually.

This movie takes classic roles and turns them upside down and
then...turns them a little bit more. It's about Power relations between
an employee and employer and then between man and woman, that are simply
""when boy meets a girl"" or ""when boy makes girl drink milk from small
plate"".

Regardless to the relationships that are developing between young, new
intern and his company's CEO, we have a view of her with her family and
how it runs, when the woman is also in the top of the chain inside her
house. The only chance that she finds herself submissive is with a young
man, that turns the power relations around and takes control.

Nicole Kidman is fantastic and has a great performance, Harris Dickinson
turns out to be a great playboy, for another role in (almost) a raw. And
though Antonio Banderas's character has a small part, he is almost
stealing everyone's thunder with a gentle and such an accurate role.

I've enjoyed this movie. It was arousing, but something didn't work for
me. Like a football team who has a lot of great players but ends the end
of the season without any title, this was the feeling in the end. Close
but not cigar, good but not great, tries to dare, but doesn't dare at
all. Maybe next try will be much better.",7
144,"Like Nicole's facelift, not well done.

You would think watching Nicole Kidman climaxing several times is an
appealing idea but the truth is it gets quickly boring. The plot of this
movie is like Nicole Kidman's facelift, not well done. It's all very
repetitive, slow, and not really interesting. I should have watched
Fatal Attraction again, that movie had at least some thrills. Nicole
Kidman and Harris Dickinson play the secret lovers but their chemistry
is just not that thrilling. I would have liked a bit more scenes for
Antonio Banderas, adding a bit more tension, but even in his scenes it
was all a bit dull. People might like this movie, I didn't, like I don't
like cheaters.",5
145,Not as provocative as the trailers implied,6
146,"This film only confirms one thing....

Nicole Kidman likes the young D. The fact that she was in 2 films within
3 months of each other where she's an older woman with a younger guy,
plus previous roles in earlier films, it's such a bizarre way to be type
casted as IMO. But it's definitely happening.

This film doesn't say anything interesting about its topic, the theme
has been done hundreds of times before in other films, often times far
better than here. The only real unique thing about the story is the
gender swapping of the roles compared to most films of this type.
Although again, it's not that big of a stretch for Kidman herself
considering her recent cinematic history.",2
147,"How could she do that?

Nicole Kidman delivers a virtuoso performance in Babygirl, anchoring the
film with her usual intensity. Her portrayal is both commanding and
tender, elevating every scene she's in. Antonio Banderas and Harris
Dickinson also shine in well-crafted roles that give them plenty of
material to flex their considerable talents.

The opening sequence sets the tone, drawing the audience in with a blend
of sex and errotica. As the story unfolds, the film builds on this
foundation, delivering moments of beauty, intrigue, and drama. However,
despite its promising trajectory, Babygirl stumbles at the finish line.
The ending feels like a narrative cop-out that undermines the emotional
investment built throughout the film.

While the conclusion may leave some viewers unsatisfied, the journey to
get there is still worth taking. Kidman's performance alone is reason
enough to watch, and the strong supporting cast ensures there's plenty
to admire along the way.",6
148,"Hard to believe

Suspension of disbelief-I'm always willing to open my mind to the world
of any given story. But the plot needs to meet me halfway.

It may sound exaggerated, but this is my honest impression: this movie
doesn't have a single scene that's remotely believable. Not a single
one. From the very first minute (literally the first minute of the film)
to the final scene, passing through every moment in between. And it's
important to point out that it's not about doubting the existence of
people with very unusual fantasies; rather, the situations in this movie
are completely implausible. I'm not talking about one or two moments,
but every scene, the entire film. There are even moments where the movie
openly flirts with the ridiculous (there were two or three instances
where I heard people in the theater laughing- at the sheer nonsense of
the situations and lines).

Nicole Kidman is an amazing actress, no doubt about that. The problem
isn't with her performance. But I can imagine that she gets more than a
dozen offers to work on different projects, and she has the luxury of
choosing which ones to take on. And for me, it's really hard to believe
this was the best project she had on the table.",2
149,"what a thrilling, liberating movie

Watched at venice movie festival in sala grande with the cast.

The movie is thrilling and audacius with a good soundtrack, and great
performances by Nicole Kidman, Antonio Banderas (he has some truly good
moments) and Harris Dickinson. I think the scripts starts quiet ordinary
but it becomes then more and more interesting with a final take on
sexuality and women which is truly remarkable. Halina Reijin is also a
skilled director who also put in this movie an incredible club scene
(one of the best club scene I have ever seen in my life, it was like she
wants the all audience in Venice to bring out the inner hidden animal).
Also Kidman obviusly commands the entire movie with a performance that I
am sure will be always remembered

Probabnly the movie will be released during Christimas and I can just
say it's totally right :)",8
150,"Get What You Want?

Throughout this overly serious, not-very-erotic thriller, I kept
wondering if the comedy was intentional or not. Everything feels so
overwrought-edited with jarring sound effects like gunshots, screams,
and slams, as if it's a horror movie desperately trying to frighten you.
It only amplifies the secondhand embarrassment surrounding the lead
characters.

Harris Dickinson's character sums it up well when he says their
relationship feels like ""two kids,"" as both leads convey an almost
constant awkwardness. The ending, however, pushes believability too far,
though it does give the writer an opportunity to deliver a sanitized,
box-office-friendly message about kink. But if you're looking for real
kink, watch Secretary. This isn't a movie for true freaks.",6
151,"Totally unrealistic Bull Crap

The first thing that shows that this is a total waste of time, is the
mousy weak worm of a dude that attractive as all hell Nicole Kidman
would fall for.

The believability scale of that union is non-existent, so I can't put
much faith in this nonsense keeping me interested more than a minute.

This reminds me of those 70's Gialio movies from Italy and Spain which
gave you a bevy of beautiful women and the worlds ugliest men that they
had to fake relations with.

For this to rate above a two shows just how easily some people can be
entertained with sub-standard drivel.

I'm just glad that I didn't pay to see this tripe, and my advice is to
avoid at all cost. Unless you are one of those who can be entertained by
watching a bug crawl across your windshield.",2

153,"Nicole Kidman shines in unpretentious sexual thriller

Dutch director Halina Reijn writes and directs a sexual thriller that
manages to have moments of remarkable seduction, but which drags on a
bit, preventing it from wrapping up more fully.

Nicole Kidman in her fantasies.

At 57, Nicole Kidman continues to captivate as the great feme fatale she
has always been, and this time she does it with the maturity of an
actress who allows herself to do what she wants and do it well and shine
as in her best times. In a leading role where her role as Romy is
everything to make this thriller work. Kidman carries on her shoulders
the masterful moments that the director achieves and also makes the less
graceful points that the film has much more sustainable. Having Kidman
being seduced, exploiting her sexuality and satisfying her desires is an
entertaining erotic journey that best sums up the film created by Halina
Reijn , who with the character that the director contains in her
staging, truly manages to give us sequences that raise the temperature
and sit on the throne of those great classics of this type of genre in
cinema, making it clear that it comes close, but does not equal it.

A stimulating journey, despite its weaknesses.

The film is not entirely well-rounded, mainly because it goes on longer
than it should or gets tangled up in a couple of subplots that take away
more than they add. However, the skill of a fairly solid cast that
accompanies Kidman, such as Harris Dickinson or Antonio Banderas, allows
this erotic journey to work despite its flaws that can be uncomfortable,
along with a successful direction by its director who knows what she
wants to show and how to show it even if it goes on longer than
necessary.

A soundtrack that manages to give that extra something.

Perhaps one of the most significant successes of the film is its
brilliant soundtrack by Cristobal Tapia de Veer, which elevates the best
sequences of the film to the rhythm of INXS or captivating electronic
music that play a great complement to the proposal they are offering us.

Conclusion.

An erotic thriller that shines thanks to its protagonist and a director
who knows what she's doing. In any case, it's a film that doesn't end up
being completely rounded and promises more than it ends up delivering at
the end of its credits, but it's entertaining, has brilliant moments of
eroticism and dares to give something more in the search for personal
satisfaction of its protagonist. It's a fun game that's worth getting
into and enjoying, especially for the queen Nicole Kidman.",6

This movie was built around the premise of a high powered CEO who risks
everything to have a torrid affair, which sounded so juicy, but failed
to deliver on all accounts. Even all the sex scenes couldn't save this
movie from being dull and done before. I never once got the impression
she was ""risking everything"" and the lack of chemistry between Kidman
and her male lead was painful to watch because you could literally feel
the awkwardness between them and not in a sexually exciting way. Kidman
has played the sexually frustrated/abused/bored housewife before and
it's getting old. Speaking of old, Kidman looked too old to be playing
the mother of ""tweens"" in this movie which was somewhat distracting. And
what's with the orange hair? The male lead had absolutely NO ""on screen""
charisma which together with Nicole's done before sexually frustrated
""act"" made this movie plain BORING.",1
157,"Same rating for me as everyone - ordinary

The script was not amazing but the Director could have saved it and
didn't.

The male lead had no charisma, not sure why he was chosen.

I feel Nicole needs to stop with the erotic movies already - is this the
third? She doesn't pull it off.

They seem to be trying for a fifty shades but wrong Actors. Banderas was
fine. Overall its an example of having a famous Actor doesn't mean the

It was definitely not what I was expecting. I found it awkward, weird,

thought"" issues. I can't say too much more without spoiling, but most of
the characters were odd, even the youngest daughter. Romy's husband was

Business executive ""Romy"" (Nicole Kidman) is initially impressed with
the dog-handling skills of ""Samuel"" (Harris Dickinson) but when she
discovers that he is to be an intern in her e-packaging company
something else starts to draw her to the man. We already know that
though happily enough married to ""Jacob"" (Antonio Banderas) she's not
exactly fulfilled in the bedroom department, and ""Samuel"" seems to sense
that it's an area that maybe he can help with. Were not just talking
sex, here - oh. No. This is about a lady with fantasy of being
dominated. About her surrendering control completely, and if you're
going to do that at all, then why not this tall, handsome and
mischievous bit of rough? Of course, like any addiction - it starts to
get out of control as the relationship dynamic changes quite profoundly
and others start to put two and two together. At times this is quite
funny, and milk seems to play a central role from time to time, but as a
cinematic version of something akin to tantric, it doesn't really work.
Neither of these actors are afraid to get naked yet neither do,
simultaneously, here. Indeed I'm sure I saw his black Calvin's shining
from under the sheet when the intimacy consultant was at their busiest.
I didn't need nudity to augment their unique sort of passion, but I did
expect something way more natural, visceral even, and I didn't get it.
It's filmed in such a disjointed and bitty fashion, there's no attempt
to characterise or contextualise either of these people and in the end I
felt like this was little better than a titillation for it's stars that
didn't really aspire to engage those watching any more than age-related
porn might. Dickinson isn't remotely charismatic and the premiss falls
flat quickly, especially when the quite aggravating intervention of
""Esme"" (Sophie Wilde) rather summed the shallowness of the whole thing
up. ""Eyes Wide Shut"" (1999) or ""Beach Rats"" (2017) showcase both their
talents amidst a sexually charged environment far better: this is all

eroticism in my cat licking herself, I spent most of sex scenes wishing

be a stick figure yeah, he had THAT much charisma. She was supposedly
highly intelligent and successful woman, yet everything that came out of

163,"Raw and naturalistic erotic drama

A high-powered, no-nonsense corporate CEO (Nicole Kidman) has everything
going for her and likes to be in charge of things - except for in the
bedroom. She's never been sexually satisfied by her husband of 19 years
(Antonio Banderas), when she meets a young, fumbling intern (Harris
Dickinson), who might just share her particular desires. Dubbed as the
comeback of the erotic thriller, a subgenre that had its heyday in the
early 1990s, Babygirl actually has much more in common with its most
obvious inspiration, Secretary from 2002. Though, contrary to E. Edward
Gray's situation in that film - a boss at the office who also enjoyed
being the boss in his sexual encounters - Romy Mathis has much more
trouble reconciling her sexual preferences with her professional
persona. This conflict is arguably one of this film's strongest points.
Writer/director Halina Reijn's raw, naturalistic approach gives the film
realism, but it's a frustrating form of realism: We're let in on the
characters' inner secrets and urges, but we're constantly kept in the
dark about the machinations that govern them. Romy and Samuel are
novices in their own world, giving Kidman and Dickinson numerous scenes
to explore and display their chops, which they do with proud boldness,
but few in which the film offers us any release. We're invited to
observe, not to take part and feel. And the strangely moralistic
Banderas character, who is supposed to represent the viewer in some way,
doesn't seem to belong, neither in the film nor in Romy's world.",6
164,"Don't Bang the Intern & Other Cinematic Lessons

Nicole Kidman is the only real gravity in Baby Girl, a film that flirts
with psychological complexity but keeps defaulting to cliché kink;

Her performance, elegant, almost clinical, deserves a script that trusts
the audience's intellect. Instead, the movie builds an implausible
romance whose origins strain credibility from the first act: a chance
encounter stretched into obsession without the emotional scaffolding
that would make it believable. The relationship at the film's core feels
like a screenwriting exercise rather than human behaviour. The initial
attraction is presented as a given, a cinematic axiom rather than
something earned. We never see the genuine psychological drift that
would explain why Kidman's character, a woman of discipline and interior
life, would surrender to such a transparently manipulative dynamic. What
could have been a study in projection and loneliness becomes instead an
aestheticized shortcut.

Mainstream filmmaking has turned forbidden mentorship into a default
sexual tension template. Baby Girl clings to that pattern: age versus
youth, intellect versus impulse, control versus chaos. But there is no
interrogation of why these power dynamics persist, just another glossy
reproduction of the same tropes. The film flirts with subversion but
never commits to it, allowing Kidman's gravitas to do all the moral
heavy lifting while the camera fetishizes imbalance.

Midway through, a George Michael track blares over a surreal release
sequence that feels almost parodic. It is meant to be ironic catharsis,
a moment of pop-infused abandon, but plays as juvenile escapism. Rather
than deepen the emotional consequences, the scene trivializes them,
signalling pleasure as shorthand for liberation without interrogating
the repression that preceded it.

The movie's greatest failure is its refusal to explore the psychology
behind pleasure and transgression. Every erotic beat is surface level,
style replacing insight. Trauma, repression, and the need for validation
hover at the margins but are never metabolized. What could have been a
modern Dangerous Liaisons for the therapy generation instead becomes a
fashionably lit fantasy that tiptoes around the very depths it hints at.

Nicole Kidman turns in a performance of eerie control, a woman
half-aware that she is trapped in a screenplay that does not trust her
intelligence. Baby Girl mistakes mood for meaning and risk for
revelation. In the end, it is a beautifully dressed case study in
Hollywood's inability to move on.

We are all stuck in low budget Netflix Amazon matrix. Someone send a
messiah of cinema to liberate us all.",3
165,"Film's unrealistic resolution in third act is over-the-top female
fantasy

Blue Is the Warmest Color it is not. For as much hubris as the
filmmakers/producers made about this potentially being NC-17, it sure
fell flat on delivering any erotic scenes (even for an R movie)...I
honestly thought I was watching a censored version for the Asian market.

My biggest issue with this undramatic and tame movie is the unrealistic
ending that only exists in female fantasy. It is a dead giveaway of the
writer/director's gender and perception of the world. Everything ends in
a very satiable way to our protagonist: a husband and family retained, a
'problem' disappeared, the other adulterer in turmoil, a high-profile
career kept, and magic orgasms from the unpleasurable.",6
166,"I felt like puking

I've never publicly reviewed any movies before but I made an account
because I disliked this one so much. I didn't go into it with any
expectations as I only went because cineplex is having $5 movies this
month. I really need to start watching movie trailers because it really
wasn't worth the time or money. No- it's not my type of movie but there
wasn't any depth to it either so there was no escaping. I kept
questioning why they would make it.

One positive is that the cinematography was good. The club scene made me
actually feel like I was in the club. It should have a flash warning
though.

167,"Sex and Sensibility

I would love to heap praise on this movie, but much of what makes it
exceptional is tied to moments and details I wouldn't want to spoil.
That said, I can say this: it's a rare example of an erotic film where
the sex scenes are deeply character-driven, not gratuitous indulgences
designed for the director's satisfaction.

This film is mature, intelligent, and daring, operating on a level that
respects the audience's ability to think and feel deeply. Unlike the
melodramatic thrillers we often associate with eroticism, such as Fatal
Attraction, this movie offers a refreshingly realistic exploration of
sexuality-one that acknowledges its profound complexity.

Desire is rarely straightforward. Our passions and kinks often defy easy
explanation, arising from parts of ourselves we may not fully
understand. Yet, we feel them with undeniable force. For once, here is a
film that gets it-one that portrays the messiness of human intimacy
without reducing it to a spectacle or a simplistic morality tale.

This is a story that understands its subject on a visceral level,
offering a nuanced, unflinching portrayal of the way sexuality weaves
through our lives. It's a film that challenges, excites, and provokes
thoughtful reflection-something that is all too rare in this genre.",9
168,"""Babygirl"" Tries to Be Bold but Ends Up Bland

""Babygirl"" had all the ingredients for something bold and compelling,
but it ended up feeling pretty tame and oddly far-fetched. I really
liked the overall message - it's an important subject that should be
explored more - but the movie itself just felt messy. It never really
committed to being one thing, bouncing between an erotic thriller, a
workplace drama, and a cautionary tale without fully landing any of
them.

Nicole Kidman is, of course, stunning, but she felt miscast here. With
all the surgeries, her expressions are so limited that it made it hard
to connect with her character on a deeper level. (And don't get me wrong
- I'm all for people doing what makes them happy, but in a role like
this, range is crucial)

Overall, Babygirl had potential, but it never quite found its footing.
It raises an important conversation, but as a film, it doesn't stick the
landing.",6
169,"Here we go again

Female ""empowerment"" taking on the form of a storyline involving a much
older woman going after a much younger man.

This time though the dude looks old enough to be her grandson.

How much further are they going to push this tired old scheme?

I know old Hollywood was filled with older actors being cast opposite
younger actresses, but the plot of the story didn't have to do with her
age. And the older actor's character targeting her because she was
younger. Outside of Lolita, of course.

It seems like movies nowadays are lazy, with this same old older
woman/younger man storyline, but the older woman going after the man is
purposeful, and his age is used as some sort of titillating, validating
factor.

Funny though when male characters are portrayed with much younger
actresses, they are perceived as dirty old men going through a midlife
crisis.

When an older woman does it she is seen as ""chic"" and ""liberated."" As
someone else pointed out on here, what's with the hypocrisy and double
standard.

This storyline is becoming real tiresome, but if they want to keep
pushing it, then call it what it is. A dirty old woman looking to
validate herself by nabbing a younger man. To prove to herself she is
still worthy. I mean, that's what women have said about men in the same
situation.

Haven't we also heard for years that actresses who age are aging out of
so many movies (""unfairly"") by comparison to older actors who can still
get great roles.

Hardly. In fact, there are a lot of great roles for older actresses.

But why do so many have to do with this theme of hooking up with a much
younger man.

Surely there are better parts for women out there that have some
substance rather than dummying down to this same old trope.

Let's see some creativity in storytelling. Let's see some storylines
where some of our great, older actresses are cast, but there isn't yet
another young man involved.

We need to see women empowered through their skills and offerings as
successful women. Not just their attempts at validating themselves with
younger men.",1
170,"Despite the heat, it doesn't make you sweat

Babygirl is a production that I have followed since the beginning and
that caught my attention immediately, the role reversal, seductive and
fetishistic tone of the story with a courageous confrontation of norms
filled with conflicts and manipulation from all sides that heated up
this story of passion. Unfortunately, Babygirl is a categorical example
of the difference between intention and execution.

Kidman's joy in her beautiful promise and projects with female directors
is palpable. In a position of power and influence, Kidman deeply
understands the freedom she has and explores this power behind the
screen to help bring Halina Reijn's vision to life and this is
admirable, her dedication on screen contaminates Harris Dickinson who
also delivers what the story demands. It's a shame that the story can't
keep up with the same brilliance of its protagonists.

There are moments of genius here that manage to bring to life what could
be the polished version of this story, but despite a hot story with two
actors on the boil, Babygirl doesn't manage to melt the ice completely.

I hope Kidman continues with such projects and Reijn continues to polish
her identity, already with great work under her belt with BODIES BODIES
BODIES.",6
171,"Power is in many circumstances true vulnerability

Nicole Kidman is really the attraction of this movie. It shows that a

is no chemistry with the intern. This said Nicole Kidman is brave and
not afraid to push the envelope of certain preconceived taboo. This
movie explores a bizarre dependence where the powerful CEO of a large AI
company decides to explore her sexual vulnerability with an Intern. The
Intern looks like a Russian mob who loves to play games and explore the
whatever control/power he has over Nicole Kidman. The story is an
unorganized patchwork of highly unrealistic circumstances where the
Intern keep running into Nicole Kidman and is a willing partner of her
sexual fantasies. Her husband played by Antonio Banderas shows a lot of
understanding and wants to keep the family together. Overall the movie
is an interesting sexual thriller and I love the fact that for once it
is the female CEO who abuse her power to seduce an intern. But power in
many instances is tue vulnerability.....",6

Save your time and money. Lackluster and pointless arthouse porn with

judgment. Nicole Kidman and Antonio Banderas bring big-name crash carts
in an effort to keep this film alive, but their efforts are weak and
wasted. I considered walking out three separate times, but didn't
because I kept thinking, ""It's got to get better."" It does not. With
just one or two different camera angles, this is easily marketable to
adult film distributors, so maybe look for a ""Director's Cut"" at your
local porn house in a couple of months. The producers should have signed
a DNR instead of an NDA.",1
173,"6/10. Watchable but not recommended.

This is a weird movie, and not always in a good way. I kinda liked it
because it was somewhat unpredictable, trying to be different than one
might expect reading the synopsis (Older married woman in a sexual
relationship with a younger man).

But the result is confusing.

BABYGIRL is bold whereas in a strange way, it remains conservative. It
is about sex and passion whereas it's not sensual neither erotic. Kidman
gave a good and fearless acting performance whereas she had zero
chemistry with Dickinson, not for a moment their lust for each other was
convincing.

Furthermore, this movie wanted to be unpredictable and up to some point,
it was. I didn't understand who's the victim and the victimizer here,
for instance, the only person i viewed as a villain was Sophie Wilde
because her character was a hypocrite and manipulative person. I kinda
liked that both Kidman and Dickinson fell into a moraly gray area and
the nature and the dynamics of their relationship was not clear.
BABYGIRL strived for originality. Unfortunately, the situation finally
became confusing and messy rather than exciting. In the end, every
character here was unlikeable and not interestingly unlikeable, more
like bland.

BABYGIRL tried to be different than a typical drama/romance with people
with age gap. I appreciated it, hence the 6 stars but at the end of the
day, a movie with this plot should be entertaining, thrilling, sensual,
with characters so interesting in order to empathize with them or try to
understand them if they're enigmatic. And, in that respect, it failed.",6
174,A banal melodrama with ill concieved psychosexual elements,3
175,"push-pull

Greetings again from the darkness. Oscar winner Nicole Kidman long ago
entrenched herself as one of the best and most daring actors working
today. Not one to shy away from risky material, she's appeared in such
films as EYES WIDE SHUT (1999), DOGVILLE (2003), BIRTH (2004), and THE
NORTHMAN (2022) to name just a few. It's her talent and willingness to
put herself out there that has earned such respect among peers and fans.
However, despite that admiration, this latest is one of my least
favorite films of the year, and one that I found almost no positives to
discuss. I will readily admit this opinion puts me in the extreme
minority.

The first feature film from writer-director (and actor) Helena Reijn was
BODIES BODIES BODIES (2022), a festival and indie favorite. That success
led to this cast which finds Harris Dickinson (THE IRON CLAW, 2023, and
WHERE THE CRAWDADS SING, 2022) and long-time favorite Antonio Banderas
joining Kidman. Now, despite my negative reaction to this viewing
experience, I do recognize that some credit is due for tackling an
uncomfortable topic - an unethical dominant/submission relationship
between a powerful CEO and her intern. We are supposed to believe Romy
(Kidman) is incredibly important and busy because her cell phone is
constantly in use (but then that's the case for most teenagers, too).
Once again, Hollywood proves that it's clueless on how to authentically
present a business environment.

Further stretching the scenario beyond any realm of believability, cocky
intern Sam assertively pursues a taboo relationship with the big boss
rather than work towards a job offer that most interns focus on. While
there is a bit of fun in the early ""will they or won't they""
cat-and-mouse scenes, once things move forward, the film takes on the
tone of a power play parody. ""Good girl"" draws laughter from the
audience ... as does her suggestion of ""Jacob"" (her husband's name) as a
safe word.

The ramifications for CEO (or wife and mother) Romy never carry the pain
we would expect, and the threats always seem a bit hollow. None of this
is meant to purport that dominant/submissive desires and relationships
don't exist, only that this extreme is difficult to buy into. On the
bright side, Banderas shines in the moment he flashes his anger, and
it's a real treat to hear ""Never Tear Us Apart"" by INXS blasting on a
theater sound system. Nicole Kidman is gaining momentum for yet another
Oscar nomination for her performance, so again, I'll admit to being in
the minority with my opinion on this one. Still, I can't bring myself to
recommend, even if I hope you find it more entertaining than I did.

really connect the dots at first because of the primary image, however;
I presume if someone were to see it without any preconceived notions,
they would enjoy it more.

Regardless, the characters are very well-written. I would've prefer much

I certainly had my doubts going into ""Babygirl"" after seeing the

any movie anytime so i thought, why not give it a look. I am not picky
about movies and I enjoy most of the movies I see. Heck, I even like
Lifetime movies and B shark movies for crying out loud! ""Babygirl""
describes itself as a Drama, Erotic Thriller, Crime, and Thriller genre
movie. I don't see how the movie can be described as a crime genre movie
when no crimes are committed in the movie. Maybe it is because it was a
crime for Nicole Kidman to sign up for this one. I realize Ms. Kidman is
at an age when actresses struggle in their careers but please Nicole,
there must be better roles out there. With that being said: Nicole did
an outstanding job of acting in the movie and the cinematography was
above average. The movie seemed to go around in circles at times as it
seemed to have two second acts and a very convoluted 3rd act. Redeeming
qualities in ""Babygirl"" were the social commentaries on power in the
workplace and in relationships and the fact that women in our society
still struggle to achieve top positions in the corporate world and the
work place and politics. We still have not had a female President. I
found Nicole's family to be quite interesting and entertaining. Her
husband was played by an aging Tony Banderas. The family was a super
liberal one and was actually quite funny. The family scenes were the

best choices for the main roles. There was no chemistry between them and
many scenes looked cringey instead of arousing. I don't see the thriller

185,"The Library as Mirror and Portal: From Romy in ""Babygirl"" to Angela
Carter's Subversive Wisdom

One often stumbles upon unexpected treasures within the familiar
confines of one's own library. It's akin to discovering a hidden alcove
brimming with untold stories, a serendipitous encounter that hints at
unforeseen avenues of learning. Such moments can forge surprising
connections between seemingly disparate forms of artistic expression.

For the present observer, the initial spark for this intellectual foray
emerged from a rather compelling cinematic portrayal. The character of
Romy, brought to life by Nicole Kidman in Halina Reijn's ""Babygirl,""
resonated with a particular strength. Her on-screen presence conveyed a
potent sense of freedom and a nuanced empowerment, striking a chord that
felt both deeply personal and subtly profound. This character, in
essence, became a catalyst, prompting a quiet quest for kindred spirits
in narrative form.

This pursuit led, rather intriguingly, to the literary realm of Angela
Carter. It became apparent that Carter's work engaged with similar
undercurrents. Much like Romy's unconventional strength in ""Babygirl,""
Carter's writing revisits well-worn tales with a fresh and often
audacious perspective. She subtly dismantles traditional roles and
delves into themes of power and autonomy with an insightful and
occasionally unsettling gaze. Her reimagining of classic narratives, for
instance, often features protagonists who are far from passive,
possessing a complexity and agency that defies expectation.

The discovery of Angela Carter within the library's hushed aisles,
prompted by the lingering resonance of Nicole Kidman's performance as
Romy in ""Babygirl"" (penned by Halina Reijn), underscores the fascinating
interplay between different artistic mediums. The cinematic portrayal
served as an unexpected gateway to a literary voice that echoed, in its
own distinct way, those initial stirrings of understanding. In this
light, the library transcends its function as a mere repository of
books, becoming a rather enchanting meeting place where personal
journeys intertwine with the enduring power of story.",8

feels clunky, and the story seems utterly confused about what it wants

of the supporting characters. There is absolutely no chemistry between
the leads, making their relationship feel forced and unconvincing.
Meanwhile, Antonio Banderas, playing the husband and the supposed third

receiving little to no development. I can count on one hand the number
of films that portray BDSM authentically, and this one fails to make the

A drama that tries to characterise the personal and professional

of his behaviour. A woman who, at first sight, seems to have a stable
private life, suddenly falls in love with a young teenager who saves her
from a dog and decides to do everything he wants.

In terms of performance, I think Nichole Kidman does a good job with
such a difficult character. On the other hand, Harrison Dickinson's
seemed arrogant throughout the film. Sometimes it was a bit hard to
understand why he was behaving this way, as he changes from arrogant to
a sweet love in an instant.

192,"Banderas saves the show

What frustrates me about Baby Girl is how it never fully delivers on its
potential. It claims to be a sensual and erotic film, but it's more
awkward than anything else. Harris Dickinson's character is poorly
defined-he's supposed to come across as a dominant, seductive, masculine
figure, but instead, he's just an uncomfortable guy who doesn't even
seem to enjoy what he's doing. Are uncomfortable scenes a problem? Not
necessarily. The issue is that the director doesn't commit to anything.
It's not uncomfortable enough to be a psychological thriller, nor is it
erotic enough to explain the characters' motivations. The script feels
half-baked, and as a result, it's easy for viewers to stop believing in
the story-and honestly, I get it.

I gave it the benefit of the doubt mostly because of its technical
aspects. The second half of the film, when it ditches the cheap
eroticism, is where the real tension kicks in. Antonio Banderas steals
the show-his two scenes left me stunned. Other moments, like the
nightclub scene, are very well done. All the awkwardness of the
beginning finds its footing in a suspenseful turn led by Banderas, which
salvages some of what was lost-but not enough. The movie ultimately
feels underwhelming, which is a shame because the script has genuinely
funny moments, and Nicole Kidman delivers a solid performance. Still,
the strong scenes in the second half can't make up for the weak first
half. With a clearer sense of direction, this film could've been so much
better.",7

excellent performances by both Nucole Kidman and Harris Dickinson, it is
a drama where the chain of events out of the routine and the ordinary
tragically makes sense. Not a single action of any character in the
film, be it stupid, irresponsible or morally disgusting, was not
credible. The script is very careful in exploring the borders, sometimes
strict and sometimes fuzzy, between the ""real life"" (the professional
and the family) and the fetiche and fantasy. Those borders may be
demolished, what is not nice but may happen. That is what the movie is
about and does it very competently, with good dialogues and pace. By the
way, Nicole Kidman deserved more the Academy awards for best actress

overacting category, and I didn't like it. Harris Dickinson's
performance made me watch the movie. Although it's by no means perfect,
it does its job in revealing the woman's deep passions.

I think the movie crashes right at the beginning when Nicole Kidman
appears on screen with an oily wig on her head and a fake expression on
her face with messy makeup. I think she overacts a lot. Her shabby
appearance gives the impression of a pitiful woman who is in the wrong
place at the wrong time. Nicole Kidman should have been less expressive
in her expressions because now that she's overacting, her Botox-hardened
face takes on a less attractive appearance. She gives the impression of
a depressed, needy woman who might need medication.

And if he's a tough CEO, why does she seem scared and insecure? She's
easily taken aback by Harris's speech and answers. No tough CEO would
act like that, they'd know how to hold their own in front of an intern.
She's completely taken aback like a little girl when Harris kisses him.
In the scenes where she finally seeks reassurance, she seems arrogant.
In a really fast pace, Kidman became a puppy begging for affection who
bends to the will of an almost unknown young man. Not believable either.
It wasn't until the last few meters of the film that we saw a glimpse of
that tough CEO when she clashed with Sebastiania.

I liked the tie scene where Nicole sniffs Harris' tie, I would have done
the same. You can almost smell the scent of aftershave here. A really
sexy scene. I especially like Harris' acting, he seems to be one with
his role. He's put on his role like a comfortable garment that's good to
be in. Her alluring gaze captures the viewer and makes you want more.
Harris Dickinson is the new Brad Pitt.

The film is shot in a brutally realistic way, revealing all the
wrinkles, lines, freckles all over her body, bony knees, botox fillers,
very unfavorable for Nicole Kidman. In addition, Kidman has no feminine
curves at all, her nudity is not arousing but rather surprising. Of
course, she is not supposed to look twenty, but now it is left to wonder
why Harris fell for her when there are so many more attractive women
around. I wish someone else had played this female lead. Someone who
would have brought credibility to the part. Nicole Kidman seems
unconvincing and fake. She fails in her role to portray a confident and
experienced CEO struggling with her passions and finally humiliating and
giving in to her desires. Quite a few women have experienced this inner
struggle when they encounter a desirable young man, but few ultimately
give in to their desires,",6
200,"Great editing and decent cinematography save it

There is nothing new about 'Nicole Kidman acting strange, cold and
distant with many internal demons' - this has been her thing for the
past 30 years. ""Babygirl"" is the latest, and the scene where she yells
at her husband was actually refreshing.

""Babygitl"" at times feels like it wants to be a sequel to ""Eyes Wide
Shut"" (Kidman, sexual fantasies, NYC at Christmas), at others is too
obviously a corporate-power-gender-reversed ""50 Shades of Gray"" for
audiences who miss the 2015 dating scene, a bit of ""Unfaithful:, and the
rest is a fenale.fantasy from the vast catalogue of Lifetime and several
Latin American films and shows. This latest ""young man becomes attracted
and obsessed with older woman"" troupe is at least more credible than the
usual, as Kidman, making a point of showing flaws and all, is still
reasonably attractive, and the young man is quite average - the exact
opposite of the usuridiculously buff yet charismatic wait-on-you but
also needs some saving young man of all of these movies and TV shows.

What kept me.engaged was the editing, with sound flowing prior to.the
start of the next scene, and the various interestimg shots and use of
light/dark that were pulled off in limited spaces. The imagery
contrasting automation with the 'work' of the spin-focused corporate
world and the social.disconnect was interesting. All.in all, it was a
fresh vibe on a cliche script about powerful women wanting to be
dominated.

It's subject matter is groundbreaking if you haven't watched much of
anything in the past 25 years.",6
201,"Waste of time

Babygirl wants to be daring, but it mostly plays like a hollow fantasy
that mistakes ""CEO + affair + taboo vibes"" for actual storytelling. The
biggest problem is that there's barely a story here, just a thin setup
meant to feel edgy, without the character work or plot momentum to
justify the time spent.

Harris Dickinson is the film's anchor in the worst way. The performance
is flat and strangely smug, with that dead-eyed, entitled brat energy
that makes his character feel less ""dangerous"" or ""irresistible"" and
more like a creepy tween throwing pseudo power games. And the movie
expects you to buy that this is the kind of person who ignites some
sweeping erotic obsession? I didn't feel tension, seduction, or even
curiosity, just discomfort and disbelief.

Nicole Kidman is asked to sell the fantasy as a high-powered robotics
CEO on the edge of an IPO, yet the film's version of leadership is
basically: look polished, float through rooms, and somehow have
unlimited emotional bandwidth for a bizarre affair while apparently
doing no actual work. Are we seriously supposed to believe that this
CEO, at this moment, has the time and headspace to spiral into ""weird
affair before the IPO"" territory in a way that feels real? The corporate
setting is there for gloss and stakes-on-paper, not because the movie
has anything meaningful to say about power, ambition, risk, or
consequence.

Older women having fantasies and sexual desires isn't shocking news, nor
should it be treated like a revelation. People have every right to want,
to experiment, to blow up a routine, to chase intimacy or adrenaline.
But the film doesn't explore that with insight, humor, or complexity. It
just gestures at it, like it deserves applause for stating the obvious,
then calls it provocative.

In the end, Babygirl isn't erotica, isn't funny, and isn't particularly
interesting. It's not bold so much as empty. Yes, some people have
questionable taste in men. Yes, some people chase extramarital drama to
feel alive. That's not a story. That's a premise. And Babygirl never
becomes more than that.",2
202,"Let Go Nicole

Nicole Kidmans performance in Baby Girl is trashy and the acting is
stiff and fake. I get the sense that she is having a hard time letting

so bad but they need another actress to play the role.",1

Everyone praises performances, script and atmosphere, but truth be told
they are the very thing that's trash about this movie. Erotic thriller.
There is something somewhat erotic about this, but the thriller is
completely missing. Cruel intentions, Unfaithful, Basic instinct - those
were actual good erotic thrillers.

Nicole Kidman's performance is absolutely cringe worthy. In one of the
scenes her daughter tells her she looks like a fish and that is quite an
actual depiction. With this movie is just like asking an elephant how to
fly: she is stiff, deadpan, not believable. The script is also so wrong,
in real life a woman in that position would find real options to satisfy
such desires without even remotely approaching the possibility to become
a joke in a work environment.

As we see woman gain more power, we will see this type of relationship
more and more. Women taking what they want the morality be damned. Men
did it when they had the power and continued to be shamed for it. Women
will do the same thing because this is a human story regardless of
gender.

You see it in small towns with older female teachers sleeping with their
teenage students, something that used to be strictly a man thing to do.
Now you see it on both sides.

It will be interesting to see how women will handle the power they are
achieving for themselves. Will history repeat itself, I believe that it
most certainly will.",10

waste of his talents. Anyone could have played that role. Furthermore,
if you are planning to watch the movie just to see him, you will be very
disappointed. So: No plot, terrible script - half of the movie is

209,"Desire, Power, and Dangerous Lines

Babygirl surprised me. It's not perfect, but it's bold, messy, and
unlike a lot of erotic thrillers, it tries to dig into the messy parts
of power, desire, and what it means to want something that might destroy
you. Plus Nicole Kidman slays.

✅ What Hit Home 1. Nicole Kidman is magnetic as Romy: She embodies both
control and deep longing. You see someone who is made to be in charge,
yet haunted by what she's not admitting to herself.

2. Samuel (Harris Dickinson) is more than just ""young intern"": He has an
unsettling calm, as though he senses exactly what boundaries exist and
how far he can nudge them. That push-pull is interesting.

3. Director Halina Reijn's tone: Not just erotic for shock or
titillation, but, many scenes feel like they are holding up a mirror to
things few films dare: sexual need, shame, consent, power imbalance.

4. The cinematography, music, and moments of aesthetic flourish: Some
scenes (the hotel room dances, Romy watching Samuel, the contrast
between her public control and her private self) were visually strong
and emotionally evocative.

❌ What Fell Short For Me 1. Underdeveloped backstories: Some of Romy's
trauma (commune, childhood cult, etc.) and Samuel's motivations feel
hinted at more than fully explored. It leaves holes in understanding why
choices get made.

2. Chemistry feels uneven at points: There were moments where the
romance/erotic tension felt rushed or forced, rather than earned.

3. Tone flip-flops: Moves between erotic thrill, psychological drama,
moral critique: ambitious, yes, but sometimes jarring. It occasionally
feels unsure whether it wants to provoke or to reflect.

4. Ending feels both satisfying and unsatisfying: It wraps up some arcs
nicely, but other threads fizzle out. For viewers wanting full closure,
it might frustrate.

🌟 Final Thoughts

Babygirl is not one-size-fits-all. It's risky, provocative, and will
make some uncomfortable (intentionally). But it also offers something
rare: a woman's perspective on desire, on control, on what you lose when
you give in. It doesn't fully succeed everywhere, but where it does, it
lingers.

If I came away from it reflecting on power, consent, the sacrifices we
hide behind careers and marriages. That means it's done more than just
shock. It did something.

210,"Babygirl tries to be provocative but lacks the intelligence or
creativity to make an impact.

Babygirl (2024) is yet another attempt at making a ""provocative"" drama
that leans too much on surface-level shock value rather than compelling
storytelling. The plot, if you can call it that, revolves around an
imbalanced relationship dynamic that lacks any real emotional depth.
There is no real buildup, no effort to make the audience care about
these characters beyond their physical interactions, and certainly no
originality. The film tries to be daring, but instead, it feels like a
predictable series of events with little payoff.

The directing is uninspired, relying on overused shaky cam techniques
that have no business in a drama like this. The cinematography does
nothing to elevate the story, and at times, it feels like the camera is
as lost as the script. The only real standout performance comes from
Antonio Banderas, but he's barely in the movie. Nicole Kidman, despite
her talent, is stuck in a role that feels more about aesthetics than
substance. And of course, we have the usual over-the-top praise for a
""bold sexualized performance,"" the same kind of overhyped reaction we
saw with Demi Moore in Substance, as if established actors being in
explicit scenes somehow qualifies as groundbreaking cinema.

The script is painfully weak, with dialogue that does little to make the
characters feel real or relatable. The film spends too much time trying
to push a message without taking the time to craft an engaging
narrative. There are moments where it seems like it might go somewhere
interesting, but then it falls back into the same repetitive themes. The
pacing is another issue, dragging through unnecessary moments while
rushing past anything that could have added depth.

The score is outright annoying. It doesn't complement the film or
enhance any of the scenes, it's just there, adding to the discomfort in
all the wrong ways. In the end, Babygirl tries to be provocative but
lacks the intelligence or creativity to make an impact. It's the kind of
movie that confuses shock value with substance, leaving you wondering
what the point of it all was.",2
211,"The movie was nothing special except for the sex scene.

In her latest film, Babygirl, director Halina Raine wants to explore
human sexual desires and their conflict with love and family, and for
this, she places Nicole Kidman at the center of her film. Have you ever
thought that maybe you could have a decent job, a dynamic family with
children and a loving husband, and at the same time, in a balanced way,
seek to satisfy sexual desires that are abnormal in the eyes of society?
Well, that's what the story of Babygirl is about, but to what extent has
Halina Raine, who in addition to directing and writing the work, managed
to make such a theme a film? Join Vigiato for a review of the film
Babygirl.

Romy Mathis (played by Nicole Kidman) is a successful and powerful woman
who heads the automation of processes by robots at a company in New York
City. She loves her husband and children dearly, but her husband has
never been able to satisfy her sexually as he should. The first scene of
the film begins with the same theme, when Romy, after having sex with
her husband Jacob (played by Antonio Banderas), goes to her laptop and
watches the sex videos she wants. Of course, the problem is not her
husband, Romy is full of abnormal sexual desires that prevent her from
having a normal orgasm. One day, when Romy wants to enter her company, a
dog is attacking her, but a young man stops her and calms the dog. This
man is Samuel, the company's new intern. Samuel (played by Harris
Dickinson) decides to choose him as his mentor after meeting Romy a few
times. From here, Samuel's relationship with Romy is formed, a
relationship in which Romy can satisfy her abnormal sexual desires and
even feel a sense of trust and love from Samuel. But how long can such a
relationship last, and more importantly, how can we ensure that such a
relationship does not harm Roman's family and career?",6

One of the worse movies I have ever seen. I walked out of the movie

every 5 minutes. I am sorry someone convinced her this was a good role
to play. I know she will look back very soon and regret this decision.
And the young was not attractive physically and had zero charm. Atleast
pick a better story line for the male actor. He seemed ignorant. I just
understand the need for all the sex scenes we get it, leave that to the

I am glad I watched this one at home alone and not in the theater

young woman anymore, and for other reasons can relate to Nicole Kidman's
character in some ways and because of the brilliant acting of hers and
Harris Dickinson, their connection is completely and fully believable to
me.

The company and family impact too... this is real life. People have
desires, wants and needs.

The fascinating thing is Samuel's ability to understand what someone
needs when he is near them and that special talent scares him, but is
his super power.

Everything is wrong with this film.

and easy narrative and thin plot, bad childhood example (the little girl
was raised in a guru-led communal environment), old and sometimes
unpleasant looking actress, fake acting in sex scenes, emancipating
women not on merit, but just for the desire to promote. Basically every
cliche. Pedophilia and bestiality are missing, but all the rest is
pretty much there.

Some reviewers tried to find some positives, like some depth of the
characters, some truth frankly revealed about today's society. Hard try!",1
216,"Oh baby

The film was actually better than I expected. I had seen the trailer and
a couple of interviews, which gave me a mixed impression-Nicole Kidman's
performance was praised, and apparently she even received an award for
it. Personally, I felt she veered heavily into overacting, and I didn't
enjoy it. It was Harris Dickinson's performance that made me want to
watch the film. While the movie is far from perfect, it earns its place
by exploring a woman's deep passions.

Right from the start, the film takes a hit when Nicole Kidman appears on
screen with an oily wig and a forced expression, her face smeared with
messy makeup. In my view, she overacts noticeably. Her shabby appearance
paints a picture of a pitiful woman in the wrong place at the wrong
time. Kidman should have used more subtle expressions-her exaggerated
acting, combined with her botox-stiffened face, gives her a less
appealing presence. She comes across as a depressed, needy woman who
might require medication.

And if she's supposed to be a tough-as-nails CEO, why does she seem so
timid and insecure? She's easily flustered by Harris's words and
reactions. No real CEO would behave like that-they'd know how to keep
their composure in front of an intern. She's completely thrown off when
Harris kisses her, like a little girl. Later, when she finally tries to
assert herself, she comes off as arrogant. In a matter of minutes,
Kidman transforms into a puppy begging for affection, bending to the
will of a nearly unknown young man. That's not believable either. Only
in the final moments of the film do we catch a glimpse of the hardened
CEO when she confronts Sebastiani.

I liked the tie scene, where Nicole smells Harris's tie-I would've done
the same. You can almost smell the cologne. It's a truly sexy moment. I
especially admire Harris's acting; he seems completely at one with his
role. He wears it like a comfortable garment that fits him perfectly.
His captivating gaze draws the viewer in and leaves you wanting more.
Harris Dickinson is the new Brad Pitt.

The film suffers from a lack of plot and solid writing. Kidman also
fails to bring credibility to her role. Just saying she's a CEO doesn't
convince the viewer when she doesn't behave like one. A
leader-especially a female one-is typically poised, stylish, and
confident. It's hard to believe someone in that position would be
rattled by an intern's remarks. Where's the thriller? Nowhere. There are
rushed meetings, but even those feel ordinary-nothing fresh is brought
to the scenes.

The film is shot with brutal realism, exposing every wrinkle, line,
freckle, bony knee, and botox filler-highly unflattering for Nicole
Kidman. She also lacks feminine curves; her nudity isn't arousing, just
puzzling. Of course, she's not expected to look twenty, but it leaves
you wondering why Harris falls for her when there are far more
attractive women nearby. I wish someone else had played the female
lead-someone who could've brought credibility to the role. Kidman comes
off as unconvincing and fake. She fails to portray a confident, seasoned
CEO wrestling with her own desires and ultimately surrendering to them.
Many women have experienced that inner conflict when faced with a
desirable young man, but few actually give in. I wanted to like this
film, and especially Kidman, but unfortunately it left a bland
aftertaste-like drinking a glass of vintage red wine diluted with water.
It's a shame, because this could've been so much better.",6

218,"A Superficial Attempt at Depth!

Babygirl is an unsuccessful attempt at exploring the complexities of
human desires and psychological relationships. What could have been a
deep and thought-provoking character study ends up as a shallow and
artificial portrayal of sensitive themes.

The characters-especially Romy and Samuel-are so flat and underdeveloped
that the audience struggles to connect with them. Even by the end of the
film, their motivations remain unclear.

The film tries to ride on themes of sexual freedom and self-acceptance,
but it comes across more like a pretentious ad campaign than a
thoughtful piece of cinema. The dialogues are so clichéd and forced that
they disrupt the viewer's immersion.

The climax and ending are not only unconvincing but feel almost
insulting to viewers who have invested over 90 minutes. The sudden
change in Romy's husband's behavior lacks any emotional or narrative
foundation.

Babygirl tries hard to appear intellectual and thought-provoking, but
beneath its glossy surface, there's little of real substance.

That said, despite its narrative flaws, Babygirl does have a few notable
strengths that set it apart from other psychological dramas. Nicole
Kidman delivers a powerful and layered performance as Romy, portraying
her confusion, strength, and vulnerability with great nuance.

Overall, Babygirl occasionally manages to provoke thought and offers a
visually engaging experience thanks to strong acting and confident
direction, even if it falls short in terms of psychological depth and
narrative coherence.

In the end, Babygirl fails to deliver the emotional and intellectual
depth it promises. Instead, it offers a confusing, preachy, and
ultimately forgettable experience. If you're looking for a film that

anorak. There's no rhyme nor reason as to how they end up together. It's
a mess to begin with and it only gets weird as it tries to box-tick it's
way to glory. Honestly, what kind of lives do the people who up-voted
this love or what kind of cinema do they watch? This is beyond drivel.
And not because of the sexual content or any lack of morality or
anything like that. I'm no prude, I've seen all sorts but this is just
simply not believable. Everything is awkward and nothing about it is
believable. Characters like this may exist in real life but it would
take a million universes for them to act this way with each other.
Honestly, my brain is broken after this. One of the worst movies that I
have ever seen. I like Nicole Kidman, I like Antonio Banderas and I

A24 usually has me in its pocket, though this time i'm caught somewhere
between fascination and indifference. Its latest offering proves that a
strong connection doesn't always require extensive romantic
development... although here, it's the physical intensity that takes
center stage.

The script wavers between subtlety and impulse, achieving moments of
genuine tension but sometimes falling into a repetition that wears down
its impact. Still, there are performances that surprise, and others
that, while not at their peak -like nicole kidman, whose high point for
me remains the others- manage to bring to life characters with more
depth than they initially reveal. Although there isn't much character
development, i have to say i liked how they are built; it leaves you
wanting to keep watching them despite the plot.

Visually, it's elegant. There are shots that play with the viewer,
hiding more than they show and letting the imagination fill in the gaps.
There are also flashes of well-handled themes: a strong female presence,
an unexpected character that adds to the whole, and an ending so
decisive it almost redeems everything that came before. A cast that
could be considered inclusive, but doesn't overshadow the film or ruin
it, like in the little mermaid.

It's not a work that makes it onto my personal favorites list, but i

other productions treading similar ground... yes, even those that made a

Nicole Kidman works so frequently that it's easy to see how some of her
performances might fall under the radar. Released in the US on Christmas
Day, 2024, ""Babygirl"", distributed by A24, wasn't allowed to fully bloom
in people's minds before awards season; consequently, Kidman wasn't
nominated by BAFTA or by the Academy, though this fearless performance
by the actress is certainly one of her best (she was Golden
Globe-nominated, and she won Best Actress from National Board of
Review). Female CEO in New York City, heading up an automation company,
is brought to her knees (literally) by a coolly arrogant, handsome young
intern. She's been married to a loving man for 19 years, but she's
unfulfilled in the bedroom; once this self-assured kid starts showing
signs that he's got the same kinks that she has (or fantasizes about at
night after her husband goes to sleep), the CEO finds herself meeting
him in hotel rooms and dancing all night at a rave club. But, what burns
hot eventually cools down, and writer-director Halina Reijn is almost
too ready to bring in a veiled threat from our heroine's all-knowing
assistant, tears of worry from her lesbian daughter, and a blistering
retort from her husband, leading to a somewhat limp finish of
""redemption"". For the first hour, ""Babygirl"" is striking and
exciting--like ""Nine and 1/2 Weeks"" turned up a few notches--but the
finale plays things too safely. Still, Kidman is worth-watching; she's
ready to take this character all the way out on a dangerous limb. ***

Where to start. I was quite intrigued by the trailer and the reviews so
i gave it a go. Big mistake!!! This movie is well overrated. The plot is
nothing new or special that we have not seen before. The acting is
pretty debatable and the characters sometimes can be very annoying.
Kidman's performance is praised by so many people, i just dont get it. I
lately find her with the same facial expression in most of her work,
even in this movie, which says a lot. If you replaced the main cast with
some unkown actors it would easily be one of those cheap
sexy/drama/thriller B movies. Do yourself a favour and spare yourself of

Despite being one of (if not the) most intelligent films of its year,
the vast majority of the general public-and even ""film nerds""
(posers)-have proved themselves entirely too stupid to understand its
complex messages and multifaceted quality.

The majority of viewers are so sex-negative that, as soon as they see
sexuality represented on screen, their brains completely shut off.
They're so overwhelmed by their disgust (fueled by internalized sexual
shame and juvenility) that they cannot see beyond it-which is what
creates reviews as incredibly ironic as: ""This film was gross."" Calling
Babygirl, a film about the negative effects of sexual shame, ""gross"" is
akin to wearing a dunce hat and telling everyone on the street you eat
chalk.

On the other hand, there are viewers whose brains are too rotted by porn
to understand that it is not simply another 365 Days sex fest. Babygirl
balances meaning and fantasy, which has proven far too complex for many
to handle.

The only real issues with the film are its pacing (it's slow at points),
its visuals (especially color grading), and the fact that if you're not
into the fantasy it sells, there's an element of the film you may not
enjoy to its fullest.",8

Halina Reijn

I decided to watch Baygirl to support Halina Reijn, a Dutch director I
admire as an actor. What started as a gesture of support quickly turned
into an impressive viewing experience that completely captivated me.

Nicole Kidman's performance was absolutely breathtaking. I had never
seen her like this before: pure, open, vulnerable, and intimate. Her
chemistry with Harris was remarkable; every scene felt like a shifting
balance of power between them, moving from strength to vulnerability and
back again. This dynamic unfolded so naturally, always driven by love as
the central force.

Halina Reijn's directorial choices are nothing short of brilliant. She
captures the vulnerability and strength of a woman in a way that is both
raw and beautiful. Her approach felt genuine and personal, which made it
a deeply emotional and valuable experience for me as a viewer.

and have the confidence to admit what she really wants felt so real.

Ahh yes, the good old 'erotic thriller', oft made, oft over-hyped,
rarely living up to all the fuss. Well surprise, surprise, this latest
'sexually-charged' offering is as flacid and disappointing as a horny
over 55 without the little blue pill to hand!

A-List superstar Nicole Kidman takes top billing as a fit, high-powered,
over 50s CEO who (laughably) gets romantically involved with her young
intern and soon loses herself in wanton acts of 'power exchange'
debauchery, while her colleagues sheepishly look on and her simp hubby
(Banderas) gets the cold shoulder. It doesn't take long for the ensuing
mess to start snowballing while the groaning from the screen is usurped
only by that of the viewer - it gets that bad that quickly.

The storyline is slow, predictable and about as sexy as a pair of old
socks stuck to the celing. While Kinky Kidman just about manages to hold
your attention, the lack of chemistry between leads is telling, while
the rest of the cast are lame, unlikeable and throwaway. Meanwhile the
all-too-familiar script gets laughably more proposterous as this
implausible 2 hour adult soap meanders along to its cop-out ending.

Do yourself a favour and just avoid this trite rubbish, it makes 'Fifty
Shades' look good! I suggest revisiting old classics of the genre like
'Unfaithful', 'Body Heat', 'Basic Instinct', 'Bound' and the master of
mainstream erotica Adrian Lyne (Fatal Attraction, 91/2 Weeks, Indecent
Proposal) instead. Off you go, tail between legs...",3

247,"Steamy story for middle-aged audience

At its best, Babygirl reflects Nicole Kidman's obsession with staying
young and attractive and her powerlessness against aging. Both her
efforts to stay young and the unavoidable signs of aging are captured on
film, in what almost feels like a cruel documentary. In one instance,
Samuel says she ""looks like a Mom"" and later on her daughter says she
""looks like grandma"". The internal struggle with aging of Romy the
character is a reflection of the struggle of Kidman the actress. It's
the most interesting part of the movie and a truly courageous role for
her.

At its worst, Babygirl is a form of Fifteen Shades of Grey cushioned
with enough correctness to make it acceptable to independent and
middle-aged audiences. Because you see, even in a dominator-dominated
situation, it's all consensual and if you think about it, the dominated
woman really is the one to hold the power. ""Okay, guys, we checked the
boxes. You can now roll the steamy BDSM scenes to the rhythm of catchy
hits from the 80's"". Let's not even try to hide who the commercial
target of these steamy scenes is.

Unfortunately this second aspect of the film is dominating, and it's
disappointing and silly. Ironically, in this movie about female
empowerment, the character who ends up stealing the show is Samuel.
While everything Romy does has a well laid-out explanation, no effort is
spent on trying to explain Samuel. Because why would you? Men are pigs
and there's no other explanation needed, right? Except that we as the
audience know it's not quite that simple, and we keep wondering what
drives Samuel. Superbly acted by Harris Dickinson, that deviant abuser
is actually the more sympathetic and attractive character, exactly
because his actions aren't explained along some cooked textbook answers.",4

stereotypical arrogant and emotionless or should i say emotionally
unavailable male (or female in certain cases) - the bad guy - is still
more sought after rather than the opposite - the nice boy next door

249,"It's better than expected

Being Dutch, like the director Halina, I was very sceptical. A lot of
movies coming from Dutch directors revolve around sex and often
portrayed in a very explicit manner that doesn't always help the story.

Babygirl is different. It is provocative and explicit, in a good way
because it actually serves the storyline. There is a suspense to it,
platfullness and eroticism that is quite unique for contemporary movies.
It dares to be uncomfortable and challenge your beliefs on
relationships, sex, power dynamics.

I read a lot of people having a hard time with the fact that both
characters don't have to face a lot of consequences from their 'bad'
behaviour. I see this differently. At the end of the day they are both
grownups and the movie is not about exploring the me-too theme at all,
it is not ment to be moralistic and judge these characters. It's about
exploring female desire.

And I have to say both lead actors give stellar performances. That also
helps!

251,"What was Nicole Kidman thinking?

Nicole Kidman plays the wealthy CEO of a revolutionary company
headquartered in the Big Apple which pioneered the use of robotics to
deliver products to customers. She was an honors graduate from Yale so
she's supposedly smart, and lives with her husband and daughter in a
suburban house worthy of her success.

But behind the facade her husband, who directs plays on Broadway, does
not sexually satisfy her, and if the part she's playing matches her age
in real life, she has a hyperactive libido for a woman approaching 60.
She also shoots her face full of Botox giving her a plastic look and her
stringy hair makes her look unkempt.

That's the background for this totally absurd tale of sexual depravity.
Her large company with offices in a midtown office tower hires a group
of interns with no defined purpose or roles. One of these interns who
stands physically head and shoulders above the others is an arrogant boy
about a third of her age with a permanent leer on his face who somehow
pegs her as sexually submissive, and while his smug insolence should
have resulted in his immediate dismissal, in this sick fantasy of sexual
domination she risks her career, her company and her family so he can
humiliate her through cringeworthy acts that show she is in need of
serious psychiatric help.

I don't know what Nicole Kidman was thinking when she took on this
project. I mean, it's not like she needed the money or the work. But
it's put an indelible stain on her impressive filmography, and frankly
after watching this display of pointless filth I felt like I needed a

dentist

So I really hated this movie, though I gave it 2 stars because the
cinematography was good. Despite its genre assignment on IMDB,
""Babygirl"" is not a thriller. The most exciting part of the movie was
when it ended and we could finally leave.

One of the biggest problems with ""Babygirl"" was that everyone in it is a
two-dimensional character, though two-dimensional characters who behave
in ways that don't seem to be within the realm of human possibility
(like the intern character who somehow has unlimited access to the CEO
of a major company and who also apparently has the ability to do Jedi
mind tricks on people and dogs, though this hasn't helped his career
since he is pursuing an internship at age 30).

Watching ""Babygirl"" was kind of like being stuck at a dinner party with
a bunch of self-centered, overly-confident, shallow, humorless people
who kept telling disturbing stories about their sex lives, except the
movie cost me $12 to feel that annoyed and uncomfortable.",2

performances even more now that I know the plot and ending. The writing
is generally solid and I like how real the whole drama felt.
Writer-director Halina Reijn gives a new take to what is not a fresh
subject matter. Both Nicole Kidman and Harris Dickinson are impressive

gives a new definition to police interrogation when she spreads her legs
to the cops in ""Basic Instinct?""

This movie is a miss. There is nothing wrong with bdsm, but it is
usually done more tastefully and certainly more theatrically to a film
audience then the idea of telling your female CEO to get down on all
fours like a dog in a crappy motel room.

This is not an attractive young man to Kidman's older, and well known
body and persona; he reminds me of a white supremacist snot nosed Trump
supporter, so the attraction, for me, is not developed at all between
the two.

If you want to show bdsm scenes, try handcuffs on a shower head or ties
on a bed post. There is no need to use vulgar language or smoke
cigarettes or say things like "" I don't need a girlfriend."" It's all
about consent, but if I pay to watch it, please make it interesting.

Honestly, I expected something more sizzling. Poor Banderas, who plays

Midway through, I caught myself wondering when things would go wrong -

the line between passion and destruction is getting thinner with every
scene. You can tell the director is Dutch: there's a raw directness and
emotional realism that cuts through the glamour. The music is also

offering depth, it relies on shock value and exploitation.

dialogue feels unnatural, and the cast delivers their lines with all the
enthusiasm of a high school play gone wrong.

The story itself is a complete mess-filled with plot holes, nonsensical
character decisions, and scenes that feel thrown together without any
real direction. The pacing is all over the place, and just when you
think the movie might be going somewhere, it either drags on endlessly
or jumps to something completely irrelevant.

And don't even get me started on the editing! The transitions between
scenes are jarring, and the cinematography does nothing to help the
already weak storytelling. It feels like the film is trying to be deep
and emotional, but it ends up being unintentionally funny instead.

enough to heat up the scene IMO. There's one scene where she's sitting

she looks opaque. So very not a fan of hers unless it's not obvious. Any
number of beautiful age appropriate actresses could fhave made this

265,"A Problematic Movie Lacking Substance

I specifically made this IMDb account just to leave this review. This
was the worst film I have ever seen. And that was not due to the acting,
which was, to be fair, phenomenal from all members of the main cast. I
cannot fathom how someone would think this movie was in any way
feminist. This is one of the most sexist movies I have ever seen.

Neither lead characters take the dynamic that is portrayed seriously or
deal with it in a healthy way, only talking of safe words after
countless hookups. Romy, played by Nicole Kidman, never at one point
makes an effort to discuss or explore her desired dynamics with her
husband in an healthy way, and acts like a child who ""can't get what she
wants"" but actually never taking the effort to get it in a healthy way.
Samuel is even worse, displaying childish outbursts and unhealthy anger
management, which immediately made me uncomfortable, reminding me of an
abuser. It is at first played off as this freeing act where both people
get what they want and perhaps even heal in that way, but despite Samual
playing like he deeply understands this dynamic and powerplay, none of
his actions and behaviour actually reflect this, and so comes off as an
unsympathetic liar. I involuntarily gagged while in the cinema after the
milk scene, and it made me feel sick for hours afterwards. That a
supposedly powerful and wise woman that has issues with her body-image
like Romy is supposed to trust someone like that, put everything on the
line for a manchild that can't even communicate like a grown adult, is
incredibly unbelievable and frankly frustratingly stupid. In a way both
deserve each other, as they are both admittedly manipulative
never-thinking-with-anything-but-their-groan characters.

For those who are unfamiliar with these unflattering sex scenes on the
silver screen, it may appear progressive and innovative, but if you look
further you'll see there is little substance below the surface. Just
like a lot of contemporary Dutch media that is supposedly progressive,
this is shock-value after shock-value with no actual deeper thought or
emotional depth. A media that so often glorifies sex as this all-freeing
activity around which large parts of life should be centred, as if there
is no other way to be satisfied in life. A resolute fear of not taking
itself seriously enough has resulted in a reluctance to adding humorous
moments, and thus failing on adding moments to catch your breath or
making watching these movies even a smidge enjoyable. For all
transparency, I am also Dutch and a woman, but this supposed ""national
pride"" I've seen a lot of Dutch people that have been positive about
this movie display that did nothing to make this movie anything but 115
minute-long torture. If it wasn't that I went with this movie with a

ultimately just - uninteresting. A waste of what is a pretty good cast,

269,"An Exhilarating and Provocative Study of Power Dynamics at Every
Configuration Possible.

In keeping with a recent trend wherein longtime female A-listers make
boldly erotic provocative performances - as with Emma Stone in Poor
Things, and Demi Moore in The Substance - critics have, rightly or
wrongly, consistently lauded these performances with high acclaim.

Most obviously evocative of Fifty Shades of Grey - yet in my estimation
not nearly as cringeworthy - as well as Disclosure, Basic Instinct, The
Boy Next Door, and sharing plot points with the shamelessly low-brow
Lifetime movie Psycho Intern, the movie, thankfully, remains supremely
intelligent without going campy or murderous.

While others have suggested Nicole Kidman has made a career of
unsettling roles, I must say this one is perhaps the most daring and
unsettling - more so than we've ever seen Nicole Kidman before.

Rooted in eroticism, power dynamics, and in all likelihood childhood
traumas, the movie relies on a massive amount of nuance in every
interaction and conversation - both in the workplace and interpersonally
- and repeatedly begs the question... ""Who actually has the power here?""

Antonio Banderas, who appears in the movie for good measure, early on
comes across as merely a prop and a generic unfulfilling husband. It is
only in the final act that his veteran acting chops are put to good use.

As the movie wound down to a conclusion, I did start to feel that there
could be no ending that could reasonably be satisfying. And, frankly, to
that point, one could make the argument that the movie did in fact end a
little too ""neat"" and convenient. But I won't let this takeaway from
Kidman's performance and the thought-provoking emotional conflicts

Winny actually liked the concept in theory-he thought the idea had
potential and kept saying it could've been something cool if it was just
handled differently. Willow, on the other hand, was way into the vibe.
He was all in for the drama and the edgy stuff, like he was living for

expectations and just wanted a movie night with her friends. At first,
it started promising and we all thought we might be in for something
interesting.

But... yeah. The writing? Not great. The characters felt kinda flat and
a little off. Like, sometimes things would happen and we'd all just look
at each other like, ""Wait, what was that?"" There was too much focus on
the sexual tension and not enough on making us care about what was
actually happening. Which, yeah, we get it-that was kind of the point of
the movie-but still, it got old fast. Some of the scenes were just
awkward instead of intense, and not in a good way.

By the end, we were all kind of disappointed. It just didn't land. The
movie had all this potential to explore something deeper, but it leaned
too hard into the shock factor and left the rest hanging. Could've been
smarter, could've been more fun, could've been just better.

Would we watch another erotic thriller? Maybe. But next time, it better
have more than just that.",3
271,"disappointing film with problematic morals

Babygirl is a film that, while perhaps aiming to be edgy or emotionally
raw, ultimately falls flat due to its troubling message and questionable
portrayal of morality. Rather than challenging societal issues in a
meaningful way, it seems to glorify toxic behavior and normalize
dynamics that should be critically examined-not accepted.

The characters, particularly the leads, make a series of choices that
are neither admirable nor redeemable, and the film does little to hold
them accountable. Instead, it presents these decisions as understandable
or even justified, which sends the wrong message-especially to younger
or more impressionable viewers.

What's most concerning is how the film skirts serious issues and instead
leans into sensationalism, using inappropriate relationships and
manipulative behavior as plot devices without offering any real
critique. It may try to present itself as gritty or authentic, but that
doesn't excuse the normalization of morally flawed conduct.

In short, Babygirl is not just a misfire in storytelling-it's a film
that promotes values we shouldn't be endorsing. Morality matters in
media, and this is one example where the line between artistic
expression and social responsibility feels irresponsibly blurred.",1
272,"Horrible Movie

My sibling and I watched this separately and we both absolutely agreed
on our assessment of this film. Kidman should never have stooped so low
to do such a poorly written and directed movie--especially with such a
horrendously miscast male lead opposite her. No woman that
high-achieving and beautiful would ever be attracted to an unattractive
little punk like Harrison and risk it all. He had ZERO appeal or
charisma which made their affair repulsive all the more. The terrible
ending sealed the deal on how distasteful the entire film felt as a
whole despite the stunning beauty of Kidman. It was beauty and the beast
minus any passion.",2
273,"A Superb Performance in a Tenuous Narrative

Nicole Kidman delivers an inspiring performance as the titular Babygirl,
but the movie overall falters in its execution. The premise is
compelling and provocative, but the narrative feels underdeveloped and
disjointed. The sexual connection between Kidman's and Harris
Dickinson's characters lacks clarity, and Antonio Banderas' role is
completely mishandled, leaving his character feeling irrelevant. The
film's minimal exposition leaves logical gaps between scenes. Despite
these flaws, the film earns points for ambition and its strong lead
performance, but the overall experience falls short of its potential.",5
274,"orgasmic feast for body and mind

Well surprised at the low reviews, this movie is so sensual, It feels so
naughty to watch.

Harris Dickinson is such a sexy actor in most of the roles, but in this
one he is litterally sexy every second. The way he moves, looks, touches
his lips and face is just such a delight to enjoy. He rekindles every
sexy moment youve had with a lover, particularly the ones who controled
us, not in a cruel way but just in a way as a means to the ends of
pleasure.

I loved this movie! Nicole gave an amazing performance, and really let
herself be vulnerable, in a way eyes shut only touched upon.

As while that movie was very sensual it was with her husband, so it made
the feeling of watching the movie almost like voyarism into their
private love life.

Where as this movie really opens us to the whole power dynamics and we
get lost in the movie... The way she plays a powerful business woman,
but is in real life a powerful actress, and Harris plays the intern and
in realy life he is an up and coming actor.

The dynamics in this movie were brilliant, many people complained it had
no story, which just shows these people need to be spoon fed their
brains direction.

This movie is a sensual experience, for you to either take on Nicoles
role or Harris's in your head, and then through the movie you flit from
one to the other.

Brilliant!!!

275,"forbidden love

Although the plot is bloody and familiar, it is by no means the kind of
male pornographic novel about ""conquering the female boss"" where men are
obsessed with lust. Instead, it cleverly uses the reversal of power
relations between the workplace and sex to silently comment on the
situation of women. Analysis and care------Overcome sexual shame, have
the courage to make demands, stay away from body anxiety, love yourself
more than love having sex. Delicacy and tenderness that only female
directors and screenwriters can achieve. The daughter of the female boss
is also a bright spot in the film. She keenly discovered the fact that
her mother had cheated on her mother almost just by using the new
hyaluronic acid and botulinum toxin on her face. However, she was not
angry about it. She had even turned to her husband for a long time.
Instead of feeling bored, he comforted his mother with his own
experience and told her it didn't matter, dad would forgive you.",3

I was admittedly drawn in by the TikToks and buzz about Babygirl,
expecting an intense erotic drama. However, the erotica was basically
nonexistent. Aside from one drawn-out, cringe-worthy scene at the
beginning and a handful of extremely mild moments, there was nothing
remotely steamy about it.

I guess it's no surprise that a big name like Nicole Kidman would shy
away from truly risqué scenes, but the way this movie was marketed felt
misleading. If anything, Babygirl can ultimately be summed up as the
office-hour daydreams of an unsatisfied wife-unrealistic, weird, and
lacking in any real depth. Not sure who this was meant to appeal to, but
it wasn't me.",3
278,"Just a rip off from Kärlek & Anarki (Love & Anarchy)

""Babygirl,"" directed by Halina Reijn and starring Nicole Kidman, has
been lauded as a provocative addition to the erotic thriller genre.
However, it's strikingly similar to Netflix's Swedish series ""Love &
Anarchy"" (""Kärlek & Anarki""). Both narratives center on a high-powered
woman engaging in a clandestine, flirtatious relationship with a younger
male colleague, leading to personal and professional upheavals. In
""Babygirl,"" Kidman portrays Romy, a CEO entangled with her intern,
Samuel, exploring themes of power dynamics and forbidden desire.
Similarly, ""Love & Anarchy"" follows Sofie, a consultant who embarks on a
daring game with a young IT technician, challenging societal norms and
self-perception. The parallels in character development, plot
progression, and thematic exploration suggest that ""Babygirl"" is not as
original as it's presented. It's surprising that this resemblance hasn't
been widely discussed, raising questions about the film's originality
and the creative process behind its conception.",4
279,"Halina Reijn's 'Babygirl': A Feminist Revolution in Erotic Cinema

Nicole Kidman delivers a fearless performance in Babygirl, a candid tale
of lust, power dynamics, and control. The film explores the complexities
of female sexuality and the disarray that arises when defining one's
needs. Halina Reijn's direction channels the spirit of classic erotic
thrillers like Unfaithful and 9½ Weeks, but with an up-to-the-minute
corporate twist that is both humane and insightful.

Nicole Kidman is fearless in this brutally candid exploration of lust
and power

One of the many reasons that sex scenes in movies have faded as a
phenomenon is the omnipresence of pornography. When people can easily
click on their deepest kinks and favored objects of desire, who needs a
carefully staged R-rated ""erotic"" version?

As if to acknowledge this, Babygirl, a drama about a dangerous office
liaison written and directed by Halina Reijn (Bodies Bodies Bodies),
opens with a high-angle close-up of Nicole Kidman straddling an unseen
man, panting with pleasure. It looks and sounds like the kind of movie
sex scene that once would have been described as ""hot."" But as soon as
the coupling is over, and the man-Antonio Banderas, as Kidman's
husband-says ""I love you,"" we see Kidman slip into another room (easy to
do in their spacious Manhattan apartment), where she lies on the floor
in front of her laptop and masturbates to a grungy piece of incest porn.

The irony here is that Kidman's character, Romy, is presented as a woman
who ""has it all."" She's the CEO of her own company-an e-commerce outfit
called Tensile Automation, akin to a next-level Amazon that promises
one-day delivery using automated logistics (i.e., robots run the entire
warehouse). She has a caring, supportive husband, who's a prominent New
York theater director, and two vibrant teenage daughters (Esther
McGregor and Vaughan Reilly). And she has a ""healthy"" sex life-but also
secret transgressive fantasies, which are what really get her off. In
other words, she has it all; she just doesn't have it all in one place.

Early on, we see Romy in the office, presenting mission-statement videos
for the company, where every upbeat word is market-tested, including a
reference to how ""nurturing"" the company is-despite its all-robot
premise effectively putting people out of work. Romy rationalizes it as
liberating people from menial jobs. This sly take on corporate culture
today connects directly to Romy's pent-up sexuality and the forbidden
office hookup about to ensnare her.

Romy, with her ""friendly"" professional demeanor and eyes glued to the
constant information stream of her phone, is the quintessential boss as
highly functional control freak. Underneath it all, she craves a kind of
sexuality that breaks apart that control. The implication of Babygirl is
that it isn't just Romy-it's a societal issue. We are increasingly
rooted in technology and corporate routines, where everything is
controlled, feeding a desire to break free.

Enter Samuel (Harris Dickinson), one of the company's new interns. The
young man who ignites Romy's fantasies is much younger-a work colleague
barely out of college. Had Babygirl been made 20 years ago, it might
have been conceived as a ""cougar"" fantasy, centered on animal magnetism.
Instead, Reijn crafts a far shrewder narrative.

The two meet when the interns are given a tour of Tensile's sprawling
lower Broadway office suite. During the introduction, Samuel asks Romy
an incredibly blunt question about the company's robot premise.
Dickinson, the gifted actor from The Iron Claw and Triangle of Sadness,
has a blunt-edged charm reminiscent of a young Austin Butler. Samuel's
message to Romy is clear: ""I make the rules by breaking yours."" Their
chemistry is not about attraction-it's about the thrill of
transgression. Every time Samuel sees Romy, he hits her with another
casually hostile negging remark. His ""flirting"" is an aggressive
assault, and that's precisely why she can't resist it.

Babygirl becomes a shrewdly honest and engaging depiction of a ""wrong""
sadomasochistic affair. Unlike her previous film Bodies Bodies Bodies,
which leaned into satirical slasher pulp, Reijn here embraces a more
realistic tone. The film feels reminiscent of Fair Play but with the
emotional resonance of Unfaithful. Nicole Kidman's fearless performance
is at the core of what makes this movie work.

Straddling the identities of mother, boss, adulterer, and submissive,
Kidman's Romy embodies complexity, much like a walking mood ring. Her
character draws on a hidden truth-people in positions of power often
fantasize about submission. While prominent male executives have been
stereotypically linked to BDSM fantasies, we rarely see a corporate
woman portrayed in the same light. Babygirl turns the gender tables,
evoking comparisons to 9½ Weeks as Samuel gradually breaks down Romy's
defenses. In one key scene, he sends her a glass of milk during
after-work drinks, declaring, ""You're my baby girl."" And when she drinks
it, she silently affirms, ""Yes, I am.""

In their hotel room meetings, Kidman oscillates between submission and
resistance, and the emotions playing across her face are nothing short
of astonishing. She lets us witness the erotic battle tearing Romy
apart. The true danger, however, isn't the S&M kink-it's the breaking of
every corporate rule governing workplace relationships. Samuel exploits
these corporate protocols, using them to seduce Romy. The fact that
she's risking her entire career by having an affair with an intern only
adds to the allure. Kidman's genius lies in portraying this recklessness
as utterly human-the desperate expression of a woman too
compartmentalized to reconcile the different parts of herself.

Does it all come crashing down? Babygirl follows a more conventional
trajectory in some aspects (including one memorable eye-candy moment,
where Samuel dances to George Michael's ""Father Figure""). But one of the
film's strengths is avoiding the roller-coaster final act expected of an
""erotic thriller."" Instead of moralizing in the vein of Fatal
Attraction, Reijn aims to liberate characters already busy punishing
themselves. The film takes unexpected turns, and that's because its
ambition goes beyond fueling the thriller-it seeks to authentically
depict women's erotic experiences in an age of control.",9
280,"Oh boy...

...where do i start.

First of all, i am ( or was) a big fan of Nicole Kidman but sadly, she
is one of the people who just don't know when to stop. She should have
stopped acting when her face stopped moving.

While she indeed is a fantastic actress (which makes it even more
tragic) she's just not picking her roles wisely. Or maybe that's all
she's getting offered these days? ...who knows but point is, this movie
is a testimony of an aging woman. The story has been told a billion
times before and even better than this i might add. It brings nothing
new to any aspect of these kind of stories.

An older woman is unsatisfied in her marriage so she starts catting
around...til it goes south...groundbreaking.

Also 1000% oversexualized women (of course) which just isn't a sign of
quality. Every time there's unnecessary nudity/ sex, they should have

subject matter but the characters. I'm supposed to believe that NK's
Romy is a high-powered CEO, wife, and mother while she seemed to be
submissive in all of her roles? Her female assistant was more forceful
than her. I'm supposed to believe that HD's Samuel, who is a creeper,
strange, and awkwardly odd and aggressive, is her salvation to finally
achieve that elusive orgasm--especially when she has a supportive,
caring, sexy hubby who is still rocking her world after years of
marriage? Come on.

For what it's worth, NK and HD had fantastic chemistry...in interviews
marketing the movie. He was just too weird on screen for me to see how
these two could connect in the movie.

which she seems to accept or tolerate. After that a strange relationship
develops where the intern seeks to dominate his CEO with weird sexual
requests. At one point she has to lick milk from a saucer on the floor.
This plot is too far-fetched to be even remotely credible. Furthermore,
there is no understandable chemistry between the two partners.

The movie has received wide acclaim and much has been written about it,
especially in the directors country's media (The Netherlands), but the

This is my first review ever. This film moved me beyond words. It has
many layers, it is deeply human.

The film shows that women have desires and that we have nothing to be

because of that. Romy had lived her life like this until a young man
senses her desires that he shares. Shame and fear kept Romy from telling
her husband.

The sex scenes are tasteful, not rude at all. No unneccessary nudity.

some scenes were cinematographically nicely done. But way too naive.
Just stupidly naive. Movies aren't supposed to be this easy and the

means to support such weak scenario is a waste of money and talent I am
afraid - this could have been used to do something else.

288,"A feminist film? Really?

Nicole Kidman does some good work here. However, the film is just okay.

it's not so steamy. Lots of moaning, but no nudity. When Samuel is
dancing for Romy in the hotel room, both are so puritanically clad that
it's really ridiculous.

Samuel is an oddball character. He never really feels like someone who
would dominate anyone. Antonio Banderas is virtually incomprehensible.
He says something at the end of the film that is probably important but

At its core, ""Babygirl"" argues that those who do not share or understand

deeper emotional and psychological needs.

Nicole Kidman's fearless performance brings depth and authenticity to
her character's journey, making the film a thought-provoking exploration
of human nature. While the subject matter may be controversial,

depth performance with vulnerability like we've never seen on screen

295,"Makes Fifty Shades of Grey Looks Like a Masterpiece

In New York City, the middle-aged CEO of Tensile Automation, Romy Mathis
(Nicole Kidman), has introduced automation in the warehouse of the
company and is well succeeded. She has been married for nineteen years
to the theater director Jacob (Antonio Banderas) and has two teenage
daughters, one of them lesbian. Romy loves kinky sex but Jacob does not
satisfy her, and she watches porn movies in the laptop to have orgasm.
When a group of interns arrive at the company for an internship, Samuel
(Harris Dickinson) is a young man that chooses Romy as his mentor in the
mentorship program. Soon she feels attraction by the dominant Samuel,
who practices bondage with the submissive Romy, submitting her to sex
with humiliations. When Samuel arrives at her home and meets Jacob and
her daughters, Romy is incapable of getting rid of the intern since she
is addicted to bondage. How will this romance end?

""Babygirl"" (2024) is one of those movies with a plot so absurd that
makes ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" looks like a masterpiece. At least, the
plot of the latter makes sense, and Dakota Johnson is hot. The idea of
the CEO of a big company in this competitive world having an affair with
an intern is so idiot and absurd that only someone that has never worked
is capable to think this way. Thirty or forty years ago, the red-haired
Nicole Kidman was beautiful and hot but presently she is a weird woman
after so many plastic surgeries. In her position, she could hire the
hustler she wanted to do whatever fantasy she wanted in sex. Why would a
powerful woman select an intern in her own company. In addition, the
filmmaker uses metaphoric scenes, like the one when she drinks milk in a
plate on the floor. Surprisingly this film is overrated by the laughable
""professional"" critics. My vote is three.

Title (Brazil): ""Babygirl""",3
296,"Disturbing and Disgusting in Every Way...

If you're looking for a film that epitomizes bad acting, a nonsensical
script, and an overindulgence in uncomfortable, borderline repulsive
sexual themes, Baby Girl is the perfect example. This so-called ""sexual
drama"" is nothing more than a confused mess trying to pass off shocking
content as meaningful storytelling. The movie also has a very disturbing
way of narrative structure, putting such awkward visuals back to back.
First and foremost, the acting is atrocious, I don't even want to
remember Nicole Kidman and Antonio Banderas has been a part of this
steaming pile of garbage. Their performances felt so forced, wooden, and
at times completely nonsensical. The dialogues are also so unnatural and
empty.

The movie is simply about a powerful business woman who has a sexual
paraphilia of submission but in a very ridiculous way. Instead of
delivering a compelling story, the actors stumble through a ridiculous
script that is more concerned with pushing boundaries than telling a
meaningful narrative. The movie is filled with one absurd scene after
another, each more unnecessary and outrageous than the last. The film
seems obsessed with including as many disturbing and tasteless elements
as possible: bizarre sexual games, uncomfortable and unconvincimg
age-gap relationship, and behavior that is completely out of place for
women of a certain age, power and reputation. Instead of being an
exploration of human desires, it just comes across as grotesque movie
that leads only to one final faked orgasm scene.

The way the film portrays women is another major issue. It glorifies
reckless behavior, promotes abuse under the guise of ""empowerment,"" and
seems to celebrate decisions that go against basic moral and family
values. The concept of ""women's power"" here is distorted into something
unrecognizable, as the manager woman character engage in degrading acts
with an intern. Sex outside marriage and forgiveness is normalized to an
absurd degree, and worst of all, the couple supposedly learns their
lesson from this huge mess in the end.

The film throws in an unnecessary lesbian subplot, an underage sexual
theme and even a hint of animal abuse just for the sake of being ""edgy"".
And let's not forget all the disturbing relationships between co-workers
etc. The film goes all in on the trend of older women getting seduced by
younger men, pushing the boundaries of what is acceptable and turning
everything into a crude spectacle. The way the film revels in sexual
fantasies that are out of place and inappropriate makes it clear that
it's more about indulgence than storytelling. Fortunately we don't see
much of the nudity or obscenity, however the movie keeps hinting on
everything that can be considered as totally disgusting. It's clear the
director and the writer of this mess, Halina Reijn wanted controversy
over quality, just like her entire filmography based on similar themes.
In the end, Baby Girl is a a cinematic train wreck. It is not even
empowering for women, or thought-provoking, or even entertaining-just a
disturbing mess of bad decisions strung together by terrible acting and
a weak plot. If you're looking for a film with some depth and emotion,
avoid this at all costs.",1

part . Kidmans daughter rescues her when affair goes south as she

her to the promise land.",4
298,"confusing script

I am a very prejudiced reviewer on three levels which I must confess to
before giving a short review on the movie itself. My two least favorite
actresses are Julia Roberts and Nicole Kidman. I have no idea how either
reached fame and fortune. Nicole's accent is reminiscent of Katharine
Hepburn's stilted aristocratic tone and that way of speaking is even
more out of place in modern times. I don't know if it's her
Aussie-American cross accent layered with a self-inflicted intellectual
sounding crispness---but she never fits in with any of her fellow actors
in any work she has ever done. It's like she is an alien that just
landed and has a robotic accent. Her body movements are very stiff,
erect posture at all times, coupled with the bizarre accent and it is
always a distraction. Now that she is aging and using plastic surgery on
her face, I was shocked to see how weird her face looks. So, I don't
like her and would never go to a theater to see her movies or pay for a
movie she is in on cable tv. I only watched Babygirl because it was free
and there was nothing else on due to Easter holiday/Pope's funeral.
Reason #2 is I despise the genre of Fifty Shades of Grey type eroticism
whether it involves rich man/younger woman or rich woman/younger
man---the orgasm starved woman of Victorian times seems ludicrous in
modern computer times and messaging boards. If you haven't had an
orgasm, it is your own fault so the premise that you have to be taught
by a brash intern is boring and not believable--albeit she had other
dominance lessons to fulfill. Reason #3 was the choppy script that
delivered constant appetizers but no meal. I found Harris Dickinson the
only bright spot in the movie as he was believable/sexy. His shirtless
dance scene while holding a glass of liquor was the sexiest scene in the
movie. I compared this movie to Kidman's Eyes Wide Shut and why that
received much more critical success. The script and scenery was better
and it had Tom Cruise. Babygirl has very limited scenery. Office and her
home was 75% of the show.",5

I'm still digesting the film but I have to say I'm deeply impressed by
Nicole Kidman's interpretation. The soundtrack is another big bonus.
Everything fits perfectly on screen. The chemistry she has with Harris

the same room with them. So provocative and unique. Besides all of this,
the main subject of the movie is so necessary. We live in a world so
full of repression and taboos, where you can't really share your traumas
and fears. Nicole is not afraid of expose herself completely and
deserves all the recognition for her brilliant work. I became a huge

becomes instantly interested in a 20 something intern at her company who

faking her orgasms for nearly 2 decades.

about the consent, so long as he was calling the shots in a very
controlling way and kept a pocketful of lollies.

Unhappy wife Kidman finds out through scandal and scrutiny that she
wants out of her marriage, or does ""Romy"" want to cut ties with ""Samuel""
so she can maintain the lifestyle she's built?

The writing is on the wall for this affair when ""Romy"" starts using her
husband's name as the safe word.

Honestly I didn't care at this point so I did something I rarely do and
walked out on this movie after the only 2 other people at my screening
did the same thing with at least half an hour of screen time left.

I'd rather watch the MAFS dinner party and that's saying something!

I'm giving this movie only 2 stars out of a possible 10 because at least
the cast includes one Oscar winner: Nicole Kidman, and one Oscar
nominee: Antonio Banderas.

What either we're thinking signing onto this project beggars belief.

Thank goodness for the soundtrack which includes Robyn Carlson and
George Michael, while INXS ""Never Tear Us Apart"" is used in an erotic
montage compilation scene thanks to Kidmans contacts.

Maybe the director Halina Reijn was confusing ambition over morality,
just like her lead characters.

301,"If I could rate this movie a zero, I would

There are so many things wrong with this movie, far to many to count.
Nicole Kidman has always been a favourite of mine, but this time she was
trying way too hard to be this seductive older woman with a need to be
dominated by a much younger man.

In the movie she is married to Antonio Banderas, but with the usual
marital problems. This movie is neither brave nor inviting, I mostly
felt nauseous every time I had to watch another love scene. It was
cringe-worthy at best and vomit-inducing at worst.

If I had a gorgeous husband like Antonio, I would be deliriously happy
and not seeking the attention of a younger man, who works for me. That
was a law-suit waiting to happen. The fact that he left 'quietly' was
hard to believe.

Nothing new, nothing special, on the verge of pornography, forgettable,
despite of so much sexuality, it is boring, not impressive. I had to

306,Ridiculous Premise,1
307,"Old Lady Does Stuff With Young Man

""Babygirl,"" directed by Halina Reijn and starring Nicole Kidman,
attempts to present itself as a provocative exploration of power
dynamics and forbidden desire. However, the film ultimately falls short,
delivering a narrative that is both unsettling and problematic.

The plot centers on Romy Mathis (Kidman), a high-powered CEO of a
robotics company, who embarks on a torrid affair with her much younger
intern, Samuel (Harris Dickinson). This relationship jeopardizes her
marriage to Jacob (Antonio Banderas) and her professional standing.
While the premise aims to subvert traditional gender roles, it instead
highlights a glaring double standard. If the genders were reversed-an
older male executive engaging in a sexual relationship with a young
female intern-the narrative would undoubtedly be criticized for its
predatory undertones. Yet, ""Babygirl"" seems to expect audiences to view
this dynamic as empowering and artistic.

Critics have noted the film's failure to provide depth to its characters
or their motivations. The narrative is described as ""nothing more than a
stillbirth, devoid of character development and depth""

. The exploration of BDSM themes is superficial at best, lacking the
necessary nuance and understanding to portray such complex subject
matter responsibly.

Furthermore, the film's erotic elements are neither enticing nor
tasteful. One reviewer observed, ""The sex wasn't sexy, but boring and
disturbing""

. This sentiment is echoed by others who found the intimate scenes
lacking in genuine chemistry or passion.

""Babygirl"" also struggles with its portrayal of power dynamics. While it
attempts to flip the script by placing a woman in a position of
authority, it inadvertently reinforces problematic stereotypes. The film
fails to delve into the ethical implications of a superior-subordinate
relationship, glossing over the potential for coercion and exploitation.

So, to sum it up, ""Babygirl"" misses the mark on multiple fronts. Its
attempt to be a bold, erotic thriller is undermined by a lack of
self-awareness, character development, a superficial treatment of
complex themes, and a troubling double standard in its portrayal of
predatory relationships. Rather than being a thought-provoking piece, it
comes across as a misguided and uncomfortable viewing experience.",1
308,"Magnificent! - Seriously stop hating my review I'm a little quirky!

Nicole Kidman deserves all the praise in her career she is sensationally

directing was exceptional and amazing acting glad this is nominated! I
saw around dinner time January 2nd and quite enjoyed more than expected
especially for going in without knowing anything. Probably my only
complaint it's quite a sexual story which might be a little uneasy on
some audiences otherwise top notch all around.

Not sure if it's worth mentioning I thought it was odd how 3 girls to

whatever though hope anyone enjoys Babygirl no matter what. Also sorry

caters to is exceptionally small, the movie is a major release meant for
a wide audience.

The only audience I can imagine that would view this movie in a positive
light are either old predatory women or young hag seeking men. However I
would imagine they would crave more than just soft-core titillation. On
the other hand, normal humans are going to be naturally repulsed by the
premise based on such debuarchery. As a result, this movie provides
nothing of value to any audience.

This film is not really an erotic film in my opinion. I think that
eroticism is very well represented in Almodovar, Verhoeven, King or
these days Ducournau. Here there is a story that seems to be cut from
other stories related to attraction and desire towards minor and major
characters but that as a whole does not work! The big problem is the
main actress who plays the angel and the devil. On the one hand Kidman
gives us an impeccable performance of a housewife locked in a sexual
dissatisfaction, and on the other she does not offer, nor does she allow
her physical gifts to interpret this role to appear. There are not many
nudes here and if there is something that the erotic genre should offer
to the public it is the exploration of sensuality, desire and our human
bodies. Here there is no trace of Catherine Tramell!!!. I think you
shouldn't waste money on a theater ticket, this movie doesn't work at
all, I just think the acting of the characters is impeccable, especially
Kidman, that's all! 4/10 Stars.",4
312,"""Babygirl"" - A Film Lost in Its Own Pretensions

It's hard to decide what's more frustrating about Babygirl: its empty
attempt to appear provocative or its complete lack of depth in handling
its own themes. Marketed as a psychological erotic thriller, the film
actually stumbles over its narrative indecision, delivering a
superficial, predictable, and often laughable experience. Nicole Kidman
tries her best to give credibility to the messy script, but even her
talent can't save a film that doesn't know whether it wants to be a
social critique, a psychological exploration, or just another recycled
forbidden affair fantasy. Harris Dickinson's character, for instance, is
so caricatured and exaggerated in his juvenile arrogance that he becomes
implausible and even comical. The chemistry between the protagonists is
nonexistent, making the supposed eroticism as cold and uncomfortable as
the scenes where the film tries to take itself seriously. Moreover,
Babygirl attempts to address female sexuality and power dynamics with a
depth that simply doesn't exist in the script. Instead of a
well-constructed reflection, we get forced dialogues, disconnected
scenes, and underdeveloped characters. The protagonist's affair with her
young lover happens so abruptly and unrealistically that it undermines
any sense of realism or emotional impact. To make matters worse, it
starts with a completely dysfunctional family that openly supports the
daughter's lesbian relationships, while the submissive cuckold husband
not only forgives but also continues to tolerate his career-obsessed,
cheating wife-who shamelessly performed oral sex on her sleazy
lover-trying to sell the idea that this mess of a relationship is
actually a family.

To make it even worse, Halina Reijn's direction seems more focused on
creating a stylish aesthetic than on developing a convincing narrative.
Some sequences, meant to convey tension and desire, turn out to be
unintentionally hilarious-like the infamous ""dance"" to Father Figure by
George Michael, a scene so cringe-inducing it borders on absurdity. The
ending, then, is a complete disaster. After two hours of a film that
tries to seem profound without ever really saying anything, we are given
a rushed, artificial, and meaningless conclusion. If Babygirl had any
chance of redeeming itself, it completely falls apart in the final
minutes. In the end, Babygirl is the perfect example of a film that
wants to be controversial but lacks the courage to do so. Its eroticism
is dull, its tension nonexistent, and its attempt at psychological
analysis is shallow. If Kidman weren't involved, this cinematic mess
wouldn't even be worth mentioning. Rating: 1/10 - A thriller with no
passion, a provocation without substance, and a total waste of talent.",1
313,"10/10 - A movie about exploration of desire and vulnerability

Here's a raw, pure, and brutally honest film that stands out from the
rest. When Romy, played by Kidman, undresses, she embodies a woman
tormented by society's judgement. No matter how confident she seems in
her career, expressing her true desires proves to be a challenge. Over
time, she begins to uncover what she truly wants, allowing her inner
yearnings to finally surface. Yet, her shame resurfaces time and time
again.

What's remarkable is that the film never judges. It leaves it entirely
up to the viewer to decide what to think. The acting, at times, feels
almost awkward-far from perfect. But that's exactly what makes it so
authentic. In real life, wouldn't you feel just as lost in a similar
situation? That raw imperfection is what gives this film its power.",10

I've been. The only reason I've given this movie a ""passing grade"" is
that I didn't walk out, though I probably should have. It was freezing
cold in the movie theatre too, and if I catch a cold because of watching
this movie I am coming back and taking away the other star.",2
318,"So real - so impressive

First, I just need to say, to all the people I spoke with before I saw
this movie who told me ""This movie is not horny, not hot, not sexy, not
interesting, not good, should have gone straight to streaming, or, it
was so boring"", we are not the same. If you don't find this movie
""horny"", I honestly have no idea what could possibly capture on-screen
sexuality to you outside of straight-up pornography. If this is not a
""horny movie"" to you, honestly, what is!? What were you expecting from
this movie? I am dying to understand. My only thought is that perhaps
people who don't understand the psychological basics of S&M don't
understand what's going on here???

That aside, I naturally came into Babygirl expecting something ""mid"" and
walked out extremely impressed by what I would consider a flawless film,
and definitely a standout in the history of film. Nicole Kidman
maintains her status as an absolute queen of delivering complex,
provocative characters in erotically charged films that always manage to
have just enough separation from one another, yet they are all fully
believable as separate fleshed-out individuals (Eyes Wide Shut, and
especially To Die For, come to mind first, the latter being one of my
favorite movies ever). Noting that, it is INSANELY IMPRESSIVE that
relatively new star Harris Dickinson (Triangle of Sadness, The Iron
Claw, etc) could get dropped into a movie this intense and FULLY hold
his own with the legend Kidman herself. Dickinson delivers one of the
most complex and bizarre characters this year, remaining wholly
unpredictable and mysterious in a very unique manner, even when the film
is through.

This movie is a grower, not a shower, and it absolutely gets better as
it goes, one scene after another, the tension slowly grows as it burns
hotter and hotter. As things unfold, it becomes more and more clear that
Dutch writer/director Halina Reijn has a deep understanding for people
with sexual personalities and sexual preferences that go beyond the
basic realm of ""sex with the person you love"". The film absolutely nails
the way it showcases the double-edged sword of debauchery: the utmost
thrill, and the utter plague.

If you need to see the good guys win in the end, Babygirl is not a movie
for you. There are no angels in this film. Trouble is lurking around
every corner. It's a film about inner psychological warfare, and it's
very real. The soundtrack is phenomenal. The pacing is ace. I honestly
can't believe this is by the same person who made Bodies Bodies Bodies -
while that movie was fun, it was also pretty dumb (consciously though, I
believe) - but this one is almost a spiritual opposite, bursting at the
seams with sincere human complexity. I was beyond impressed. Definitely

sexual flings and pushing the limit, and this film certainly does all of

has an eye for fun yet he wants to be in control, and after meeting Romy
she gives in as it's just what the doctor ordered. Sexual fantasy and
fetishes are taken to the max in this film as many of the scenes are

sets in as Romy feels it's wrong to cheat in the workplace as this is a
threat to her family and career. This film call it an erotic thriller

328,"An Intimate Exploration of Power, Desire, and Connection

Director Halina Reijn is known for her sharp psychological insights and
confrontational cinema. In Babygirl (2024), she delves deep into the
complexity of desire, power, and intimacy in relationships. With Nicole
Kidman in the lead role as Romy Mathis, a successful tech CEO, and
Harris Dickinson as her young intern Samuel, a story unfolds that is
both challenging and

Romy Mathis seemingly has the perfect life: a thriving company, a stable
marriage with Jacob (Antonio Banderas), and an apparent control over her
world. Yet, something fundamental is missing in her life: sexual
fulfillment and a deep sense of connection. When Samuel enters her life,
he opens a door to a forbidden and thrilling dynamic that unsettles her
entire self-image and relationship.

The film explores in a nuanced way the psychological and emotional
tension between power and vulnerability in relationships. This closely
aligns with the insights of renowned relationship therapist Esther
Perel, who argues that desire thrives in space, mystery, and a certain
degree of autonomy. Perel's work emphasizes how intimacy and eroticism
sometimes stand in contrast to the stability of long-term
relationships-a tension that is central to Babygirl.

Babygirl is not a typical romantic drama but an exploration of the
complex reality of human relationships. It is a film that raises
questions about love, sexuality, and the role of power within intimacy.
Much like in Esther Perel's books and lectures, it becomes clear that
desire is not only about what is present but, more importantly, about
what is missing. For those open to a profound, psychologically charged
cinematic experience, Babygirl is a must-watch.",8
329,"Repulsive

I tried, I really did, but found the whole mess mostly repulsive. I had
to stop it twice to come back to it later. For one thing, since it was
NOT explicit, I never knew just what was being done sexually, so the
extreme moaning and growling made little sense to me. Secondly, Samuel
is a schlub. Seeing this classy woman submitting herself to such a
schlub was just unbearable. Romy could have simply brought Jacob around
a little sooner with a little honest communication!",3
330,"A failure

Babygirl (2024) attempts to explore desire, power, and erotic tension,
but it fundamentally misrepresents the dynamics of sexual submission.
While Nicole Kidman delivers a polished performance as Romy, a powerful
executive drawn into a dangerous affair with a younger intern, the film
treats their relationship superficially, often sliding into
unintentionally humorous territory.

It would be better if we saw a dynamic relied on trust, communication
and respect as it is about erotic tension. Babygirl, however, frames
submission almost as a gag or plot device. Romy's supposed surrender to
the intern is exaggerated, stylized, and often absurd, portraying
moments of power exchange that are cartoonish rather than
psychologically believable. The film seems to confuse sexual submission
with (non-sexual) humiliation or whim-driven manipulation, turning
serious dynamics into spectacle. This misrepresentation undermines any
exploration of intimacy, leaving viewers unsure whether the film intends
to titillate, satirize, or simply shock.

Ultimately, the movie falters in its central theme. It loses credibility
and risks trivializing a nuanced aspect of human sexuality. What could
have been a dark, psychologically rich exploration of desire ends up
feeling stylized, exaggerated, and occasionally comical.

Sex scenes?? Let's watch!

Except...it's boring. The sex scenes aren't very sexy. The chemistry

of nudity, go make commercials, or better still leave the film industry.
It's like a cooking show on tv, but one where all the food has been

At first I didn't see anything in it, aside from an anoying emptyness.
But after a night's sleep it could be a poorly executed example of the
fact that even when you mean well and think it's a mutualy beneficial
encounter you are having, your new partner might be playing you like a
cat a mouse. But then they should have changed the setting to a diner or
something, and had Nicole play a naive waitress who gets trapped in the
net of some exotic playboy. They are many out there! A CEO is simply
unsuited for that role. And after he shows up at her house, it has to
end. When it turned threatening it had to end. At the first glimpses of
his brash nature it stops.

It starts like a third-rate romcom, and then it goes downhill. There are
many of those pulp movies that start with some managers at a company
talking shop. That's when I switch it of usually. Because this rotten
egg got nominations I was curious, why? They must have greased some
pockets. Twenty years ago this would have gone straight to video, or
where it belongs, out with the garbage.

Did the vault of good movies burn down in the wildfires?

You get old lady Kidman's bare back as an appetizer, followed by the
cheque. Clever use of the moving camera that moves from her back to the
back of her head while she leans towards her husband. Directed by a
woman, it screams... The preview of her drinking a glass of milk
presented as the main course should have been ample warning, and it
doesn't get any better. Even the music is mostly irritating, three times
the same 'composition' with groans gets repeated, only closer to the end
one dance tune in a discotheque does the job. If they wanted the male
opponent to look like a lowlife they chose the right actor, he certainly
looks awful.

actors, a crappy story etc, but on the odd occasion I get a pleasant
surprise. I do read the IMDB comments but found that they are equally
untrustworthy. I only gave this movie a 1 star. It probably does deserve
a little better, but I feel the need to offset the, in my opinion, much
to high 6.2 rating.",1
338,"A Breath of Fresh Air

Brilliant! Beautiful performances. Skillfully exploring human desires,
morality, consent, flaws, ambition and power. Intellectually plotted
human sexuality and psychology..Setting traps all over the plot. Fresh
score!

It explores themes of power, sexuality, shame, and consent, and how
these dynamics manifest in the workplace. The film also examines how
women are treated in society, and how they are expected to behave... The
film also explores how Romy and Samuel explore and divulge their
boundaries as they confront ethical and moral dilemmas.

The movie may display the primary plot of the erotic thriller, but the
themes of the film are entirely rooted within Romy's personal growth and
eventual acceptance of her sexuality.",10
339,"Almost Unwatchable

I cannot even begin to think what position this dull film has on women's
sexual lives. And in my opinion this film is not erotic at all; just the
opposite. We open with the sounds of an orgasm, and we end the film with
the same, and no spoilers but the three main characters move around in a
cage of limited desires. Nicole Kidman in one scene ferociously feels
trapped by her sexual fantasies, and clearly trapped too in a power
situation with a thuggish young man with a black dog and like a dog she
is made to beg. He satisfies her but threatens blackmail as she has an
outwardly highly powered job. Ironically it seemed to me a job
concerning robots. Her husband played reasonably well by Antonio
Banderas is a theatre director, and glimpses of his production of
Ibsen's ' Hedda Gabler ' echoed the feeling that these people were
trapped, and for those who do not know the play Hedda kills herself
because of her frustrated passions. I find this a clever touch, and the
production itself looked interesting. And yet again this film's scenario
is set against New York wealth which feeds itself into its own cruel
domination. Is the film condemning Kidman's fantasies, and the scenes
with Harris Dickinson's character's emotional and cruel games which she
agrees to, and blackmailed to accept, any sort of resolution in her need
for fulfilment ? I leave the question open as the whole film is a big
question mark about how much freedom women, and men really have.",2
340,"Awful, boring, annoying.

This movie sucked. So contrived, I could guess every line. Kidman and
Banderas not believable as a couple. Intern guy not attractive or
interesting. Annoying music or sounds or whatever..All characters were
boring. Don't waste your time or money. No clue the attraction between
Kidman and intern. More like a bad mtv video than a good movie. I
couldn't wait till it was over. So dumb the little twinning plot with
her kid. So disappointing. Nothing worthy about this movie except the
dog was pretty. I felt bad for the dog that he/she was in this terrible
movie. Can't even believe this movie was made. Studied film symbolism
throughout college, and this film is nothing but vapid and cringey.
Nothing worthy about this mess of a movie. Again, very boring and
predictable. Felt like chunks of what could have been interesting and
important parts were left out. It's no Fatal Attraction or.
Unfaithful-those were excellent films. This film was just empty. The
minute of the dog was the only decent part.",1
341,"Does not live up to the hype

Romy (Nicole Kidman), the head of a large company, accustomed to
managing people, becomes the plaything of young intern Samuel (Harris
Dickinson). The rules are simple: she obeys all his orders, and he keeps
her secret. But the passion that escapes outside the office threatens to
destroy them both.

I think the film is supposed to lay bare the inner turmoil of strong,
powerful women who have latent sexual fantasies. A younger man, a
dominant man, doing things she's never tried before all lead her down a
road that is dangerous to her family, yet exciting to her. It explores
the raw sexuality that women often don't admit to, preferring to embed
their sexuality in terms of love rather than want. That's what the film
is supposed to be about.

However what it is about is nothing more than soft pornography. The sex
scenes are supposed to say something, but there is no real dialogue that
explains in detail what the main character is going through. It's just a
woman exploring exciting sex with a younger man. There are hints of her
inner mind working, but nothing spoken about in detail that airs ideas
or raises questions about the theme. So the sex actually overtakes the
film and becomes the main part of it, but divorced from any reasoning as
to why. It also seems to suggest that if you pressure a woman enough she
will give in to your male fantasies, which I think is a dangerous road
to go down. She should have pursue this relationship willingly, rather
than to be seen to be pushed into it. (Although some people might
suggest this is normal behaviour) The acting is so-so, the camera work
is pretty poor a lot of the time, and sometimes it appears there's no
direction except what the actors 'feel' in the moment. I don't think
it's Nicole Kidman's best work, and Antonio Banderas is very average,
almost weak throughout. Esther McGregor is very new and inexperienced
unlike her older sister Clara who is amazing.

So all in all it is a forgettable film, which does not spark debate, and
does zero to further women's or men's issues. I gave it a 5.",5
342,"A Shallow Story with an Unbelievable Relationship

Babygirl tries to be a deep emotional drama but ultimately ends up as a
shallow and unrealistic film. The storytelling is weak, prioritizing
controversial moments over meaningful character development. The
relationship between the two main characters is entirely unconvincing,
neither emotionally nor logically justified. The film seems more focused
on showcasing an unconventional romance rather than providing a solid
foundation for it.

One of the biggest weaknesses is the male lead's performance. He lacks
both charisma and emotional depth, making it difficult to connect with
his character. The chemistry between him and Nicole Kidman is almost
nonexistent, leaving their interactions feeling forced and unengaging.
While Kidman does her best to elevate her role, the weak script prevents
her efforts from fully paying off.

Overall, Babygirl had the potential to explore deeper emotional layers
but instead delivers a superficial story with underdeveloped characters.
It could have been a thought-provoking drama, but instead, it fails to
leave a lasting impression. If you're looking for a compelling and
authentic story, this film might not be the right choice.",5
343,"bestever

Hat really carries this film are the two excellent central performances
from Nicole Kidman and Harris Dickinson. Without them, this film would
be entirely forgettable, particularly because this film doesn't really
break new ground in its genre and the plot is thin. Sophie Wilde and
Antonio Banderas are also good in their supporting roles. Kidman is
great in portraying a woman who wants to sink into her desires, but is
constantly conflicted in doing so.

The score, soundtrack, atmosphere, the costumes Kidman wears, and
cinematography all really elevate this film. The film feels very cold
and aloof, which is in keeping with our protagonist. As alluded to
earlier, the film's biggest issue is that the story is tenuous and not
really anything new. It's surprisingly tame for what it is. It almost
felt like the film was self-conscious and scared to really go there and
be prurient. But perhaps that was intentional, to mirror Romy's
reluctance to go there herself. While there is some nudity, it never
really feels sexy. Perhaps that was the director's intent though. While
sex scenes in erotic thrillers tend to be sexy, passionate, salacious,
almost fantastical, the sex scenes in this film feel very organic, and
even awkward at times. Between Romy and Samuel there are awkward
silences, confusions as to what to do next, insecurities about intimacy.
The result is that you feel like a fly on the wall. However, as a
viewer, that is both positive and negative. Positive because it feels
realistic, perhaps relatable. But negative because much of the film is
difficult to watch. What really would have elevated this film is
fleshing out Romy's past and her dark desires.

A nitpick I had with the film is regarding Samuel's tattoos. It felt
like he was a walking bad-boy stereotype; the tats felt a bit too
on-the-nose and obvious. Dickinson's presence alone was sufficient
enough to signal to the audience his dark, dominant interiority.
Dovetailing off of that point: while it was refreshing to see a power
dynamic in a film wherein the younger of the two parties has the power,
as it's typically portrayed as being the inverse, the abrupt jump from
new intern to a forbidden affair with his boss was jarring and
implausible, if we are to believe this film takes place in reality. But
the director's conceit here very well may be a heightened version of
reality, a fantasy.

That being said, the film is worth checking out, if only for the great
acting.",10
344,"A flailing failure

I'm a fan of Nicole Kidman, but I lost some respect for her as an actor
after seeing this nonsensical waste of time. It was sold as erotic- it's
not. It plays with ideas and themes of sexuality without having a clue
of what it's actually trying to say about them. It felt like the writers
read Fifty Shades of Grey, came to some vague conclusions about women
being turned on by power struggles and domination, and tried to work
that notion into an edgy drama, without having a single insight to add
to it. This is especially apparent in the dialogue- whenever anyone has
a chance to explain what they're thinking, they just mumble and shout
incoherently. Really? A high-powered CEO who can't string a sentence
together? Who allows herself to be blackmailed by an equally
inarticulate 20-something? This is another problem with this movie-
there is simply too big of an age gap between these two ""lovers"". Nicole
looks great for a woman approaching sixty, it's true, but we all know
that's her age. I've been watching her in movies since I was a kid, how
could I not be aware of it? Watching a woman in her late fifties
crawling around on a floor at the behest of a guy well young enough to
be her son just feels tasteless and demeaning. As if this wasn't bad
enough, the film throws away the small amount of sexual currency it has
by having him literally threaten her with exposure if she doesn't do his
bidding. That's supposed to be sexy? I think not.

Antonio Banderas was a confusing casting choice as the husband, mainly
because he's about ten times hotter than the young guy, making her
choices even more baffling. He's wasted in this role. None of the actors
have any sexual chemistry, and this film absolutely required it.

Watching Babygirl made me think of 9 1/2 Weeks, a much older film which
explored these themes far more successfully. The sexual chemistry
between Kim Basinger and Mickey Rourke was electric. The power he had
over her was palpable, and it was easy to understand why she would allow
herself to get caught up in an affair that challenged her identity and
boundaries. My advice is skip this one and watch that instead.",2
345,Totally not my vibe,3
346,"A Clumsy Attempt at 50 Shades

There have been plenty of affairs gone wrong films. Fatal Attraction,
Swimfan, Unfaithful to name a few but this was the worst affair I've
ever witnessed in a movie. It was awkward and cringe almost every scene
they were together. The trailers give the impression she has an affair
with a confident, experienced and dominant young man. Nope. He's quite
the opposite and even childish and immature to boot. Huge step down from
JLo in The Boy Next Door. A younger man can be attractive to a woman if
he knows how to make love like an experienced man. However in this film
she trades in a man for a boy so it's hard to understand the appeal of
this affair as a woman. We know she has fetishes that are never quite
explained other than being turned on she could lose everything sleeping
with an intern. Honestly what ruins this film is it's attempt to go the
50 Shades route. Most women will be turned on from the roughness that
Christian Grey performs however most women do not want to drink milk out
of a saucer and have it licked off their faces. That's just not going to
appeal to the masses. That's why this film could have garnered more
respect as a serious drama instead of trying to be sexually empowering
somehow. Two damaged people came together with no explanation of their
damage. Her fetishes and his obvious mother issues could have been
explored through childhood flashbacks or even conversations between the
two. Lastly Nicole Kidman was too old for this part. Not sure why people
say she's had work done. I feel if she did she wouldn't look so old. An
actress 10-15 years younger would've been better. Then casting Antonio
Banderes just to play the cuckhold husband seems a waste. The ending was
as pointless as the entirety of the film itself and leaves one
unsatisfied. To sum up unfortunately this was crap.",4
347,"Well that was awkward...

This movie was awkward in every way - zero chemistry or sexual tension
between the leads, clumsy sex scenes, stilted dialogue, lack of charisma
or any other kind of saving grace really. I can see what kind of movie
it was aiming to be but it failed spectacularly, in every aspect. I will
give props to Antonio Banderas for delivering his lines with emotion.
His rendition of ""what the ***?"" pretty well summarises the movie, in a
nutshell. Nicole Kidman is a fine actress lost in a bad script and poor
direction. The young actor who played the intern may be better in a
different role. However he is sadly miscast in this one. As a movie
experience, this does not deliver anything worth remembering.",1
348,"A Bold and Unsettling Exploration of Power

Babygirl (2024), directed by Halina Reijn, is an intriguing and
unconventional film that challenges the audience with its unique
storytelling, strong performances, and striking visual style. It is a
movie that feels deeply psychological, relying on subtle interactions,
layered emotions, and an ever-present tension that keeps viewers engaged
from start to finish. Without revealing any spoilers, this review will
explore the film's strengths and the reasons it stands out as an
unexpectedly compelling cinematic experience.

A Visually Captivating Experience One of the first things that stands
out about Babygirl is its cinematography. The film has a sleek and
polished look, with carefully composed shots that create a strong sense
of atmosphere. The use of lighting and color palettes helps set the
mood, making certain moments feel intimate while others feel distant and
unsettling. Every frame seems intentional, and this attention to visual
storytelling enhances the overall impact of the film.

The setting also plays a crucial role in shaping the film's tone. The
environments feel cold and structured at times, mirroring the emotional
states of the characters. This artistic approach makes the movie not
just a story being told but an experience that the audience can feel.
The director's vision is clear, and it is executed with precision,
making every scene meaningful in its own way.

Strong Performances That Elevate the Story Nicole Kidman delivers an
outstanding performance in Babygirl, bringing depth and nuance to her
character. She portrays a powerful yet complex individual who is both
strong and vulnerable in different moments. Her ability to convey
emotions through subtle expressions and body language makes her
performance even more impactful. It is one of those roles that allow the
audience to connect with the character on a deeper level, even when her
decisions are not entirely predictable.

Harris Dickinson also gives a compelling performance, creating a
character who is intriguing and unpredictable. His presence on screen
adds to the tension of the film, and his interactions with Kidman's
character feel natural yet intense. The chemistry between the two leads
is undeniable, and it plays a major role in driving the film's narrative
forward.

What makes the performances stand out is how they avoid exaggeration.
Instead of relying on dramatic monologues or over-the-top expressions,
the actors deliver restrained and controlled performances, making their
characters feel real and layered.

A Story That Keeps You Thinking The narrative of Babygirl is not
straightforward, and that is part of what makes it so engaging. It is a
film that raises questions rather than providing simple answers. The
themes explored in the story revolve around power, human connection, and
emotional complexities, but they are presented in a way that allows
viewers to interpret them in different ways.

The screenplay is sharp and well-crafted, using dialogue efficiently
without unnecessary exposition. The film values silence just as much as
words, allowing certain moments to speak for themselves. This subtle
approach makes the audience pay closer attention to details, facial
expressions, and unspoken tensions.

While Babygirl does not follow a traditional storytelling structure, it
never feels confusing. The pacing is deliberate, allowing time for the
characters and themes to develop naturally. The film does not rush to
conclusions, and this slow buildup makes the key moments feel even more
impactful.

A Film That Stays With You One of the most impressive aspects of
Babygirl is its ability to linger in the viewer's mind long after the
credits roll. It is not a film that provides easy conclusions, but
rather one that encourages reflection and discussion. Different viewers
may walk away with different interpretations, and that is a sign of a
well-crafted movie.

At its core, Babygirl is a film about human emotions, choices, and the
complexities of relationships. It does not rely on unnecessary
sensationalism or exaggerated drama but instead presents its story with
a level of maturity and subtlety that is rare in mainstream films.

Final Thoughts Babygirl (2024) is an unexpectedly captivating film that
combines excellent performances, stunning cinematography, and a
thought-provoking story. It is a movie that does not conform to
traditional storytelling formulas, making it a refreshing and unique
experience. While its slow pace and ambiguous themes may not appeal to
everyone, those who appreciate films that challenge conventions and
invite deeper interpretation will find it rewarding.

For those looking for a well-acted, visually striking, and
intellectually engaging film, Babygirl is certainly worth watching. It
is a reminder that cinema can be both artistic and meaningful, offering
stories that go beyond simple entertainment and instead leave a lasting
impression.",10

I'm sorry, the actors are great but this is an obvious rip off of the

especially emotional range of all the characters. There are lot of
moments that are clearly scene to scene copy an paste, but most of the
film is translated into the 50 shades of grey-esque version of otherwise

352,"Kidman not taking risks

I used to love Nicole Kidman, not because she was pretty and beautiful,
but because I found her to be a good actress. Now, for a long time, she
plays the same role over and over again: that of a privileged woman.
(Take Cate Blanchett for example, she is still taking risks, or at least
very different roles that require different skills as an actor).

I still like Antonio Banderas, because I think he can be believable as a
solid, kind husband, but could do equally well as a villain or a scary
cult leader or whatever role he chooses.

I think Harris Dickinson and Sophie Wilde were good, but replaceable.

My main complaint, other than Ms. Kidman playing the same character over
and over again, is that this movie lacked emotion, and most of it came
from the well-chosen soundtrack.

In the subgenres of erotic thriller and age-gap romance, the conflict
comes from the confusing nature of love, lust and choices and possible
sacrifices. (They made some pretty good ones in the 80s and 90s). Here,
love is the umpteenth thing that doesn't even come to mind, as they've
chosen to make it about the female-male/female power struggle, and so a
crucial element is missing.

I've found this movie cold and calculated, not at all erotic, no matter
how many body parts were shown or sex breathing faked.",2
353,"To all the un-lovers!

This film is about a woman's fantasy. This is not about your sexual
fantasy, nor your own sex life.

So many people completely miss the point, which is that a powerful woman
is able to exercise her latent fantasy. She does this together with a
handsome young man that just happens to walk into her life.

All those remarks about Nicole Kidman having 'no class' are not only
sexist, they are deeply offending to those who believe that people (yes,
human beings regardless of their orientation or organ composition)
should be completely free in their decision making, as long as it
doesn't hurt others.

I've thoroughly enjoyed the film and as a white middle age guy I'm proud
to say that the theme and the way it was expressed deeply satisfied me.
If only because it apparently upset a number of 'conservative', pardon
me, extremists.",9
354,"Utterly points but at least so bad that it's funny

This got to be one of the most pointless movies ever. What is the point
here? That main male lead is a therapist? Resolving family issues with a
really bad cuckold?

Nicole Kidman is supposed to be some strong CEO woman that accomplished
everything except for being satisfied in bed and wants to be dominated
by a strong, assertive, dominant man, but she ultimately falls for Gatis
Kandis, but even less manly and even more awkward version of Gatis.
Besides, the writing is so weak, script, everything, and this has to be
the most unrealistic portrayal of human relationship ever. And I'm not
talking about how fast for no reason she falls for the main lead, or how
nonchalant for some reason their business communication is. I'm just
talking about how you can't even imagine two human beings actually
talking like this in the real world, no matter how dumb or awkward or
unsocial they are. And man, on their first sex scene, I've burst out in
laughter too damn hard. I'm telling you, you have to watch this movie at
least for that.

I mean, everything in this movie is bad. Acting of both male and female
lead. Writing and dialogues are just garbage. Script and everything is
simply pointless. Sex scenes are not sexy, not romantic, not sensual nor
erotic. It's like and awkward couple that are bad in sex trying to do
some sado-maso. Male leads especially. He's like an weak pathetic guy
trying to act dominant but he simply can't. This movie at one point
feels like it's supposed to be empowering. You know, accept your
sexuality, accept your fantasies. On the other hand, it's done so
utterly bad that it's degrading. And when main male lead and Banderas
get into fight, man, that's a pure comedy. I really thought that main
lead will just pour some milk to Banderas and screw him too. If this
nonsensical piece of utter garbage actually did that, I would give it
10/10 just for the sake of it.

This movie isn't empowering, it isn't sensual, it isn't erotic, it's not
thrilling, it's not even a decent drama, it's a garbage romance, it's
just simply utterly pointless.",3

long-repressed submissive sexual fantasies anymore, behave like a little
lost girl and risks her powerful position as CEO in her company in New
York City and her perfect family life for a kinky dominant/submissive
sexual relationship with this fake tattoed, moderately muscular and
average looking bad boy. Sorry, but if a movie's story couldn't reflect
the universe's basic logic structures and it couldn't present a
believable story, it lost me. I wasn't also impressed with Nicole
Kidman's overacting and the movie's choppy editing and direction either.",5
356,"Mediocre and pointless

I wasted two hours without being able to understand why this movie was
made. The drama of the sexually dissatisfied powerful women must be a
very deep and important topic.

What puzzles me even more is why fine actors like Nicole Kidman and
Antonio Banderas wanted to have anything to do with such an
underwhelming story. Kidman must have spent a lot of efforts and money
to maintain her body in shape at her age. She wanted to show it off.
Banderas probably just needed a job.

While Kidman has a proven artistic talent, her acting was not aligned
with the character she was trying to portray. The intern's attraction to
the older face-lifted woman also appeared forced. All characters were
unconvincing with fake dynamics and complete lack of chemistry.

I don't usually leave reviews, but yikes. I can't believe this movie

zero chemistry between the two leads. Antonio Banderas doesn't even seem
to know what he's doing in this movie. I also don't buy that a high
powered CEO would ever get that far up the corporate ladder if she was
the wimp that Nicole Kidman is in this movie. And it's two hours long???

I decided to watch Baygirl to support Halina Reijn, a Dutch director I
admire as an Dutch actor. What started as a gesture of support quickly
turned into an impressive viewing experience that completely captivated

Nicole Kidman's performance was absolutely breathtaking. I had never
seen her like this before: pure, open, vulnerable, and intimate. Her
chemistry with Harris was remarkable; every scene felt like a shifting
balance of power between them, moving from strength to vulnerability and
back again. This dynamic unfolded so naturally, always driven by love as
the central force.

Halina Reijn's directorial choices are nothing short of brilliant. She
captures the vulnerability and strength of a woman in a way that is both
raw and beautiful. Her approach felt genuine and personal, which made it
a deeply emotional and valuable experience for me as a viewer.

Baygirl exceeded my expectations and left me positively surprised. It's
an absolute must-watch-not just for fans of Halina Reijn or Nicole
Kidman, but for anyone who wants to be moved by a powerful film.",9

363,"Babygirl

Dutch writer/director Halina Reijn's new feature 'Babygirl' is an
exercise in boldness. The film is a fresh take on the age old story of
self-discovery and self-destruction.

In the movie Nicole Kidman plays Romy, a highly successful CEO of a
robotics company by day and sexual submissive by night. Despite having a
picture-perfect home life with a loving husband and two daughters, Romy
remains unseen and sexually unsatisfied until she meets an intern
(Samuel) at her company who sees a side of her that's she's been hiding
- her sexual identity.

Two older films come to mind when watching 'Babygirl' - Stanley
Kubrick's 'Eyes Wide Shut' and Adrian Lyne's 'Unfaithful'. All three
deal with infidelity and the razor's edge one walks when engaging in it.
What stands out in 'Babygirl' is the feral, masochistic nature of Romy
and Samuel's illicit encounters which leave Romy in equal parts
exhilarated, scared, embarrassed and liberated.

Reijn's film presents an unvarnished view into shifting power
differentials. The CEO has power over an intern just as much as a dom
has power over a sub. Romy the titan gives in to the commands of Samuel
the peon. Their initial encounters are awkward and uncomfortable both
for them and the audience. It's like watching two porcupines mate. The
fact that Romy is cheating on her husband, theater director Jacob
(played admirably by Antonio Banderas) is intriguing, but what she needs
for sexual fulfillment is even more so.

The performances are strong all around, but the film belongs to Kidman
whose brilliant portrayal is both brave and vulnerable. At 57, Kidman is
doing the best work of her career on TV and the big screen.

Reijn's direction is intimate, raw and unyielding. She pulls no punches
and lets scenes breathe until they become difficult to watch. The
cinematography is harsh and unfiltered, making the film feel more
realistic. I did have a problem with the bombastic score which, at
times, threatened to overwhelm the visuals.

All in all 'Babygirl' is a fascinatingly frank and thought-provoking
exploration of human sexuality that also turns the tables on workplace
sexual politics. Be prepared as this film earns its R rating, but it's
well worth the watch.",9
364,"Meh.

This was an interesting erotic thriller. The story features a dominant
woman named Romy, portrayed by Nicole Kidman, who is the CEO of her own
company and the head of her family. Despite having a somewhat ""vanilla""
sex life and repressed BDSM fantasies with her husband, she yearns to
embrace a submissive role, contrasting with her usual dominant persona.
Enter Samuel, played by Harris Dickinson, a young intern who possesses
all the traits that fulfill her sexual fantasies. What I disliked about
this movie was the abrupt transitions. It moved quickly from one scene
to another with little context. While the acting was great, the film
felt like a slow burner, and I found myself bored several times
throughout. I also wanted more from it. I know this isn't ""Fifty Shades
of Grey,"" but I felt the BDSM elements were rather tame. Sure, there
were forced situations involving drinking milk, secret words, and
getting on all fours, but maybe I just expected more excitement? I dont

369,"Gigantic waste of time

Got dragged to watch this movie with my girlfriend and we both agree on
how bad it was. The two main characters are both completely unlikable,
boring and have zero chemistry with each other. Their whole relationship
is just him telling her to do something and she denies it and after a
minute eventually she does it and they have sex. There's literally
nothing more to it!

I might not understand the movie because of how boring it was but I'm
confused if we're meant to like Nicole Kidmans character or be against
her because I couldn't stand her but the movie tries to make us feel bad
for her at multiple points. Also what is the message of the movie? This
might just be because I'm a guy and don't know what it's like to be a
women, but to me it seems like it's just saying that it's alright to
cheat if you're sexually frustrated and you should be forgiven for it.

The only thing I can say is good about the movie the performances were
good. Especially Antonio Banderas because he was the only character I
could tolerate and was likeable.",3

In the 20th century, greed science was applied to music so that private
ownership and licensing of recordings was lucrative. Streaming companies
are not lucrative. So artists revenue comes from live performance gate
receipts. That's why elderly artists still do concerts. There's no other
revenue like a cd sales stream. Young artists don't exist because their
music isn't revenue generating except via huge gate receipts. So they
can't get the chops after a debut album to be great. They eat by working
day jobs with no hope. Why even try to make a debut album. They won't
get paid until the draw at concerts is huge. Talent stays undiscovered
and unexploited for life.",4

an elder teenager to me (yuck). The ""sex scenes"" were not very
stimulating, but quite cold, which was probably on purpose but it was
not enjoyable to witness, not for me anyway. The family subplot was
useless & boring. The workplace plot, also boring & annoying. I felt
sick & unsettled after watching this atrocity, not hot & bothered. I'm
sure there's some sort of theme about control, power balance, etc, but
it's executed poorly. They also ruined some great classic pop songs
along the way. I usually enjoy Nicole Kidman's work but unfortunately
her face was distracting here. I feel sad about it because clearly women
are not allowed to age. She was also a bit too thin but again, that's
the Hollywood norm. This type of story has been done so much better many
times before (see works directed by Adrian Lyne and Zalman King). They
keep trying to tap into themes highlighting romance, lust, forbidden
pleasures etc. Over the last few years & they just cannot get it right,

good as well, but I couldn't tell, because the character was not written

Don't let the title of the review fool you, it's to fool the sensors
here. The second I saw A24 splash the screen I moaned and not in the
Nicole Kidman O-face kind of way. I will forever be skeptical when A24
makes a film. Because you have to ask, why is this being made. Sometimes
it's because a film wants to push a political agenda, sometimes it's to
give an upcoming actor or actress a leading vehicle. Sometimes it's just
to be edgy or for the studio to just expirement to see what works.

We'll in this case it's none of those. But instead another vessel for a
female director to tell us her kinks, because heaven forbid if a man did
it (think Basic Instinct or Fatal Attraction). To give her credit, I see
why Nicole Kidman did the movie. She wants to prove to the world she's
still got it at 60. Yes, she is very beautiful and still looks good.
Throw her character into New York and you've got a believable scenario
of a female CEO who likes to be dominated. Hey I'm telling you, you'll
need to suspend disbelief if you want to have fun watching this CEO
degrade herself to the fantasy of a 50-something that feels 25 again.
It's quite funny when the character says no I can't do this because if
so this other thing will happen. Then the other thing happens. And as
the audience were suppose to be shocked. Gasp I say, gasp!

The last 20 minutes were, okay, what else of a story do we have in this
movie dot dot dot? I must say the movie lost a few points on my meter by
making the husband (Antonio Banderas) a friggin theater director. In New
York! You mean to tell me Nicole Kidman married the only theater
director without the ability to act out a fantasy?! The guy directs
actors to do it as a job. Come on, Halina Reijn, you need to do better.

Harris Dickenson who gives her what she really wants - to be ordered
around in mildly masochistic ways. The sex scenes are neither

Im wondering why I'm not reading more comments on the age gap between

(I'm around Kidmans age.) Irrispective of the sexes, I'd feel exactly
the same aboit it if it were reversed.

The acting is fine, some moments very good. However, although I'm all
for a film exploring older female sexuality, i dont think this does
women much favors. Very staid dynamics in some ways, however 'wild' the
spin.

And even though this is a by the by, i do find it hard going having to

384,"Over hyped and under delivered

This film is so poor, it had to be written by AI. The only reason this
movie got 3 stars is for the cast, costume, and setting. I have seen
better acting in adult films.

Let's start off towards the beginning. I understand that Kidman is the
main character and all and it is focused on her, but you could have done
better for Antonio. You actually did that man dirty by having such
poorly scripted dialogue for him. I would say he took the character as
far as you could take one with how underdeveloped the dialogue was. The
only good part of the beginning of this movie was how the second main
character was introduced, this mediocre scene was probably the best part
of the film.

Let get into the meat and potatoes. I feel this part of the film is some
of the most awkward and immature though behind a movie of this stature.
The main characters have zero chemistry and zero idea of what they want
to what they are doing. The only thing that brings them together is
their sexual attraction, if there really is any. The way Harris'
character approaches the relationship is kind of mind boggling with
ignorance, the level of unprofessionalism is insane. It was ""I am going
to act upon this just because"" and this really devalues the character.
The whole middle of this thing is just weirdly obtuse.

Getting towards the conclusion seems like a typical situation between
the main characters and supporting characters. It is almost if this was
a typical conclusion to any movie plot in this nature, it is recycled.
Why not make something more realistic than trying to give some sort of
weird happy ending?

All in all, this movie is just awkward, weird, unrealistic, and immature
with nobody knowing what to do or what they want. I can't believe such
good actors took this roll, it is weak and makes them look bad. If it
wasn't for them trying to give a good performance, this movie wouldn't
be worthy of a c rating and would belong in the bottom of a bin at the

387,"A One-Sided Portrait That Leaves Others in the Dark

Nicole Kidman delivers a bold, committed performance in Babygirl, a film
that attempts to explore female desire and personal rediscovery-but does
so at the cost of empathy, balance, and fairness.

What could have been a nuanced portrait of a fractured relationship
instead feels like a one-directional therapy session, where only one
partner's needs are treated as important. The woman's
dissatisfaction-emotional, sexual, existential-is placed at the center,
while her husband's quiet presence, loyalty, and emotional pain are
barely explored or respected.

The film leans hard into the idea that personal awakening justifies
betrayal and secrecy, but offers little reflection on the damage left in
its wake. Rather than giving equal space to both voices in a failing
marriage, the story places the burden entirely on one side, reducing the
other to a background figure-there, but barely heard.

While the themes of female empowerment and desire are worth exploring,
Babygirl falls into the trap of glorifying self-discovery without
accountability, ultimately leaving a sour aftertaste. It's a film that
wants to be brave, but instead comes across as tone-deaf to the
emotional realities of anyone who isn't the lead character.",3
388,"Kidman at her best

Dutch writer/director Halina Reijn's new feature 'Babygirl' is an
exercise in boldness. The film is a fresh take on the age old story of
self-discovery and self-destruction.

In the movie Nicole Kidman plays Romy, a highly successful CEO of a
robotics company by day and sexual submissive by night. Despite having a
picture-perfect home life with a loving husband and two daughters, Romy
remains unseen and sexually unsatisfied until she meets an intern
(Samuel) at her company who sees a side of her that's she's been hiding
- her sexual identity.

Two older films come to mind when watching 'Babygirl' - Stanley
Kubrick's 'Eyes Wide Shut' and Adrian Lyne's 'Unfaithful'. All three
deal with infidelity and the razor's edge one walks when engaging in it.
What stands out in 'Babygirl' is the feral, masochistic nature of Romy
and Samuel's illicit encounters which leave Romy in equal parts
exhilarated, scared, embarrassed and liberated.

Reijn's film presents an unvarnished view into shifting power
differentials. The CEO has power over an intern just as much as a dom
has power over a sub. Romy the titan gives in to the commands of Samuel
the peon. Their initial encounters are awkward and uncomfortable both
for them and the audience. It's like watching two porcupines mate. The
fact that Romy is cheating on her husband, theater director Jacob
(played admirably by Antonio Banderas) is intriguing, but what she needs
for sexual fulfillment is even more so.

The performances are strong all around, but the film belongs to Kidman
whose brilliant portrayal is both brave and vulnerable. At 57, Kidman is
doing the best work of her career on TV and the big screen.

Reijn's direction is intimate, raw and unyielding. She pulls no punches
and lets scenes breathe until they become difficult to watch. The
cinematography is harsh and unfiltered, making the film feel more
realistic. I did have a problem with the bombastic score which, at
times, threatened to overwhelm the visuals.

All in all 'Babygirl' is a fascinatingly frank and thought-provoking
exploration of human sexuality that also turns the tables on workplace
sexual politics. Be prepared as this film earns its R rating, but it's
well worth the watch.",9

and detached.

Marketed as an erotic thriller, the movie actually lacks real excitement

395,"The only honest review you'll get

I was surprised by how many bad reviews this film got. Watching it, I
thought it was pretty solid: good cast, decent story for what it is. And
it's an erotic movie, which you barely see from Hollywood anymore. So, I
was actually glad to see something in that genre again since it's been
pushed to the side for years.

But here's the thing-if you're going to make an erotic film, you can't
play it safe. You've got to really go for it. This movie never does. It
feels like it's holding back the whole time, like they were afraid to
actually show anything. For a film that's supposed to be erotic, it
barely even has nudity, let alone any real heat.

But here's the real problem: if you're going to make an erotic film,
make an erotic film. Don't half-ass it. Don't be afraid of what it is.
This movie wears the label but feels like it was censored halfway
through. No real nudity, no real heat. And without that, there's nothing
to connect to. There's no sexual charge, no tension. Nicole Kidman:
Phenomenal acting, no doubt. But from a physical standpoint? You're
looking at an emaciated frame with two half-moon breast implants that
offer zero sex appeal. It's like the body is just there, no allure, no
magnetism. It kills what the movie is supposed to be.

Same with Harris Dickinson. I can't really judge his sex appeal, but I
watched it with my girl, and her take was that he didn't do much for her
either. So, it feels like the movie missed the mark on both
sides-there's no real chemistry, no sensual pull.

In the end, Babygirl calls itself an erotic movie, but there's no
eroticism to be found. And that's why I believe I get why so many people
came away disappointed.",5

Yet another trainwreck of a movie. I actually fast forwarded several

look like plastic zombies. And it is also time for Nicole Kidman to hang
up the sex movies. How many times can she play the same twisted in the
head sex role? I truly respect Nicole Kidman's work ethic but she needs
to take her talent in a different direction. And please Nicole, stop
messing with your face. Accept that you are no longer 20 and try to age

going to see it.

I'm so glad I did. The depth in the subtlety of Romy's predicament as it
unfolds rang so true and it was at times a very uncomfortable watch, but
without use of shock value - instead the much more artful technique of
absorbing the viewer.

The direction and story complemented uniquely well so it made sense when
I saw it was done by the same person. A woman. And it shows. To have a
story told that resonated so well with me for the first time ever shows
how underserved the freedom to tell women's stories is, and not just
some version that's been written for women with a load of female
stereotypes or expectations of what women are, including stemming from
aspects of internalised misogyny.

The only thing I felt could've been done better was the ending. It seems
Hollywood can't not have a hopeful ending, which didn't fit with the

400,"A failed and crude attempt that doesn't go beyond cliché

The film presents, on its surface, a bold and tense story about power,
desire, and ethical boundaries. This erotic thriller garnered attention
at the 2024 Venice Film Festival, earning Kidman the Best Actress award.
However, in its deeper layers, the film grapples with fundamental
difficulties in the interplay between form and content, identity and
persona, and ambiguity and explicitness, ultimately rendering it a
flawed work.

At the heart of the story is Romy Mathys (played by Nicole Kidman), a
woman at the apex of power in a modern high-tech company who, in her
personal life, desires submission. This duality, on the surface, is an
allegory for the contradictions of the modern subject: an individual who
celebrates their autonomy within the capitalist system yet privately
confronts a crisis of meaning, emptiness, and a desire to surrender to
another.

The film somewhat accurately depicts this paradox, but its philosophical
depth remains incomplete. In her interactions with Samuel, Romy
oscillates between dominance and submission, yet the film refrains from
a precise exploration of the nature of these desires. Is the desire for
submission a form of escape from the responsibility of the modern
subject? The film raises these questions but does not answer them; or
perhaps it lacks the courage to do so.

Furthermore, the relationship between power and desire in this film is
largely reduced to a visual and titillating display rather than an
internal exploration of the human psyche. This superficiality prevents
the film from becoming a truly existentialist or psychoanalytic work.

From a philosophical standpoint, the film aims to address themes such as
power, submission, and self-awareness in human relationships-themes that
could be referenced to the intellectual tradition of philosophers like
Michel Foucault and Simone de Beauvoir. In his analyses, Foucault speaks
of power as a fluid and bidirectional force that is constantly
reproduced in human interactions. The film ostensibly attempts to depict
this idea in the relationship between Romy (Kidman) and Samuel
(Dickinson), where power shifts from the manager to the subordinate and
then reverses again. However, this exploration quickly devolves into a
simplistic portrayal of dominance and submission, lacking any serious
reflection on ethical or existential complexities. Does Romy genuinely
seek a form of liberation from the oppressive structures of her life by
submitting to Samuel, or is this merely a superficial fantasy that
caters to her emotional and sexual needs? The film offers no answer and
does not even seem to take these questions seriously.

On the other hand, if we consider de Beauvoir's perspective in The
Second Sex, which emphasizes women's freedom and autonomy against
societal expectations, Romy's character is a disappointing paradox. She
is introduced as a powerful woman in the professional sphere, yet in her
personal realm, she falls into a cliché of sexual submission as if it
were the only way to express her identity against life's pressures. This
contradiction could have led to a profound critique of gender roles in
modern society, but the film prefers to indulge in seductive visual
displays instead of reflection. Consequently, from a philosophical
standpoint, the film not only lacks depth but also seems to evade
difficult questions, settling for superficiality.

From a technical perspective, the film strives to create a minimalist,
cold, and controlled atmosphere that serves the overall theme of the
film-the suppression of emotions beneath the surface of modern urban
life. However, it suffers from several clear weaknesses that undermine
its ambitions.

Jasper Wolf's cinematography (which at times recalls the visual style of
Robert Bresson or Yorgos Lanthimos) creates a sense of distance, but in
many moments, it leads the audience not to contemplation but to
indifference. While visually pleasing at times, the cinematography often
falls into the clichés of the erotic thriller genre: soft and warm
lighting in intimate scenes, camera angles that emphasize bodies, and
excessive use of close-ups to convey emotional intensity. These choices,
although aesthetically acceptable, rarely serve the narrative and more
often convey the feeling of a glitzy music video than a coherent
cinematic work.

The film's editing is also one of its main weaknesses. The narrative
rhythm is inconsistent in many moments; long and drawn-out scenes of
interaction between Romy and Samuel are interspersed with abrupt cuts to
her family or professional life, disrupting the balance. This
incoherence prevents the audience from forming a deep connection with
the characters or their motivations. For example, the scenes involving
Romy's family life-with Antonio Banderas as her husband-are so brief and
superficial that they seem included merely to fill narrative gaps,
rather than to add a layer to the drama.

Halina Reijn's screenplay also suffers from serious weaknesses. The
dialogues are often cliché-ridden and lack originality; especially in
moments intended to reveal the psychological depth of the characters,
they seem to be taken from a low-grade television drama. Samuel's
characterization is particularly weak-he is more of a narrative tool to
advance the story than a human being with his own motivations and
complexities. This imbalance in character development makes the
chemistry between Kidman and Dickinson, which is the film's main pillar,
seem artificial and unbelievable at times.

The acting, despite Kidman's relative brilliance, cannot save the film
from its downfall. Nicole Kidman's performance, while executed with a
certain control, suffers in some places from repetition and a lack of
gradual internal transformation. Samuel's character also remains on the
surface; in terms of drama, he is more of an ""object of desire"" than a
character with psychological complexity. Kidman creates moments of
honesty with the boldness and vulnerability she brings to the role, but
this effort is wasted against a screenplay that does not provide her
with sufficient depth. Dickinson, on the other hand, lacks the necessary
charisma or layers in the role of Samuel to justify his fatal
attraction-a problem that stems more from the directing and screenplay
than his acting.

The film tries to speak, with a modern and feminine perspective, about
power, desire, and the crisis of identity in an era of nihilism.
Ultimately, Babygirl is a flawed work; a film that promises a
philosophical crisis more than it delivers one. A film that stands on
the border between display and truth, but is afraid to make the final
crossing.

In the end, it is a film that has big ideas but falls prey to clichés
and superficiality in its execution. From a philosophical standpoint,
instead of a deep exploration of concepts like power and freedom, it
settles for simplistic and unreflective displays. Technically,
weaknesses in editing, screenplay, and character development prevent
even its visually appealing moments from creating a coherent or
impactful experience. This film might be acceptable as entertainment for
a general audience, but for a viewer seeking philosophical depth or
technical mastery, it remains disappointing and insufficient.",4

main story gave extra depth. And, as many said before, great acting,
really outstanding. I saw the parallels to real life and the reality of
some scenes. Wauw to Nicole Kidman who shows (again) what a great
actress she really is an how vulnerable she is in this movie. Must see.",10

This movie depicts the deteriation of the western woman who has not
taken well care of her body or soul. Instead she has spend all her
efforts becoming a CEO, and is so bond by the need to control everything
in her surroundings that she is not even good at that.. The feminine
force in the woman has died out and now she gets a shot at ressurection
through this sexual roleplay but it's so damn hard for her to surrender.
This was so painful to watch. There is no grace left in her. Her husband
is a caring loving force of nature yet she cannot get turned on by him
because he is simply too loving and she wants to be abused. To be
matched in her lack of self love.",1

I can't stand this Harris Dickinson guy. But im sure his character is

I usually enjoy offbeat stuff like this... I kinda wish there was a
different actor other than Dickinson. I feel like he doesn't quite pull
it off here. Maybe he will redeem himself somehow as I'm just about to
reach the last act. Also I've never seen him before so it's hard to make
a judgment. Kind of a slow burn obvious plot.",4

An average movie that leaves more to be desired. Babygirl is interesting

The saying, ""don't dip your pen in company ink"" is known for a reason.
Pursuing a romantic relationship with a coworker can lead to
complications and unprofessionalism in the workplace. Babygirl magnifies
this with a female CEO mentoring a new intern.

Babygirl has some entertaining and funny moments given the relationship
dynamics on display here. The movie's music score adds a layer of
suspense and creates the vibe of an exotic thriller at times. Sure,
office romances can workout but they can also create awkward situations
and potentially harm one's career and the lives of others if the
relationship doesn't work out.",5

Nicole Kidman has never been better as the CEO who gets the wild other
life she always fantised about when intern Harris Dickinson shows up.
Dickinson has the perfect menacing feel about him for his part, but its
really Kidmans show as she goes through a full range of confused
emotions throughout the movie.

Bare in mind this movie is very adult, but outside of a couple of saucy
scenes the movie isn't overwhelmingly raunchy, and is more about the
complicated psychology of the characters. Its brilliantly deep and gets
you thinking. Making things feel even darker with its awesome

409,"A hollow attempt at erotic thriller

Babygirl attempts to navigate the murky waters of power, desire, and
betrayal but ends up feeling more like a misguided soap opera than a
compelling erotic thriller. Directed by Halina Reijn, the film squanders
the star power of Nicole Kidman and Harris Dickinson, relying on
cliché-ridden storytelling and shallow character development.

Kidman, as a high-powered CEO risking everything for a torrid affair
with her younger intern, does her best to bring nuance to a script that
fails to match her talents. Dickinson, while charismatic, is given
little to work with, and their chemistry feels forced rather than
provocative. Antonio Banderas' presence is underwhelming, reduced to a
supporting role that adds little to the narrative.

The film's attempts at exploring morality and power dynamics are muddled
by contrived plot twists and superficial dialogue. Instead of delivering
genuine tension or introspection, Babygirl relies on pseudo-provocative
scenes that feel more absurd than daring. The result is a film that
takes itself too seriously without offering meaningful insight or
entertainment.

promises.",4
410,"Poor Girl

""Babygirl"" falls into a worn-out stereotype: the successful woman who,
upon discovering sexual pleasure, loses control of her own life. The
film attempts to build dramatic tension but ultimately relies on a
forced dichotomy between independence and desire, as if one cancels out
the other. The result is a predictable script that, instead of exploring
the protagonist's complexity, reduces her to a simplistic and
unconvincing dilemma. At times, the narrative borders on the pathetic in
the way it exaggerates conflicts, making genuine emotional engagement
difficult. The film lacks subtlety in character development and a more
sophisticated approach to its theme.",2

embarrassed. The characters seemed to have unsolved issues and were
moaning everytime. Regarding the actors, what a waste of Antonio

418,"Nicole Kidman Shines In Provocative Exploration Of Power And Desire

Babygirl (2024), directed by Halina Reijn, is a compelling erotic
thriller that delves into the intricate dynamics of power, desire, and
self-discovery. Nicole Kidman delivers a standout performance as Romy
Mathis, a high-powered tech CEO who embarks on a transformative journey
that challenges her personal and professional boundaries.

The narrative is both provocative and thought-provoking, offering a
nuanced portrayal of a woman's quest for fulfillment beyond societal
expectations. Kidman's portrayal of Romy is both fearless and nuanced,
capturing the complexities of a character navigating uncharted emotional
territories. The film's exploration of themes such as control,
vulnerability, and the pursuit of authentic connection is both timely
and resonant.

Halina Reijn's direction brings a sharp and insightful perspective to
the story, balancing moments of tension with introspective depth. The
supporting cast, including Harris Dickinson and Antonio Banderas,
provide strong performances that complement Kidman's lead role.

Babygirl is a bold cinematic experience that challenges viewers to
reflect on the complexities of human desire and the often-blurred lines
between power and vulnerability. It's a film that lingers in the mind,
prompting discussions about identity, autonomy, and the lengths one will
go to find personal satisfaction.",8

of the cast isn't far behind. The dialogue is stiff, the plot meanders,

Movies today have become unbearably dark, joyless, and self-absorbed and
Babygirl is the perfect example of everything that's wrong with modern

There's absolutely no chemistry between the leads, no passion, no
genuine emotion. It's supposed to be about desire, but it feels
completely lifeless. Every scene is cold, distant, and uncomfortable not
because it's deep, but because it's empty.

It's obvious the director wanted to ""deconstruct lust"" or make some big
psychological statement about power and loneliness, but the result is
just pretentious nonsense. Instead of emotion, we get awkward silence
and meaningless stares. Instead of intensity, we get boredom.

You don't leave this film thinking you leave it drained. And the worst
part is, it thinks it's clever for making you feel miserable. But making
your audience feel terrible isn't a sign of genius, it's a sign that
you've lost touch with what storytelling is supposed to do.

Cinema used to move people, make them dream, laugh, cry, feel alive. Now
it's just one long therapy session filmed in slow motion. People are
slowly getting tired of all this gloom, and thankfully, it can't last
forever.

423,"A solidly entertaining modern day erotic thriller

Babygirl promised so much and for the most part it delivers on this, but
I can't escape the feeling that it held back slightly.

Not a day goes by where I don't see tweets claiming (entirely
incorrectly) that sex scenes ruin movies and sex scenes are unnecessary.
I'm not sure what is sparking this puritanical sentimentality but I'm
glad that films like Babygirl are being made to hopefully put a dent in
this misguided narrative. In this film sex is a key player and it drives
the plot and allows us to explore the characters in great detail. As a
sexual cat and mouse game ensues between the two leads, it explores
interesting notions of power, control, and pleasure.

The cat and mouse game in question is between high flying corporate CEO
Romy (Nicole Kidman), and cocky intern Samuel (Harris Dickinson). As the
former becomes increasingly curious and drawn in by the latter, they
become intertwined in a sexual power play that makes for a most
interesting watch.

As mentioned earlier, I do think the film could have gone a bit further.
It felt like it was still a little bit tame and restrained and on a
leash, and it could have benefitted from some more ambitious ideas.

Still, this is not a major draw back. In today's climate of film it
still feels relatively unique and is thoroughly entertaining. The
performances from Kidman and Dickinson are convincing and absorbing, and
the whole thing is wrapped up and presented in a stylish package.

So while this film might not get you too hot under the collar, it
certainly delivers as an erotic thriller and is thoroughly entertaining
and engaging.",8
424,"Hardly Watchable

The premise of Babygirl feels too thin to sustain a full feature. The
story sets up an intriguing dynamic between power, desire, and control,
but it never really expands beyond its initial hook. For a film that
markets itself as a bold and provocative thriller, it comes across as a
little undercooked.

The casting also feels slightly off. Nicole Kidman is a phenomenal
actress and she certainly gives the role everything she can, but
physically and emotionally, she doesn't quite fit the part the way the
film seems to require. Her performance shows effort and flashes of
brilliance, yet the intended seductiveness doesn't fully land. Her
co-star Harris Dickinson has moments of intensity, but their chemistry
doesn't always feel convincing, which weakens the central relationship
the movie depends on.

Visually, the film looks polished and stylish, and the direction has
confidence. Still, style can't fully make up for the lack of depth in
the writing or the uneven casting choices. The result is a movie that's
watchable and at times engaging, but ultimately unsatisfying.

Babygirl isn't terrible, but it isn't especially good either-it's a
glossy thriller with strong performances trapped inside a story that
doesn't give them enough room to breathe.",4
425,"Disturbing

I felt quite sick to my stomach by the end of watching this movie. It's
mentally disturbed and sad that Hollywood makes such dark movies.
Obviously the female main character Romy has mental issues that gives
her compulsions to want to be humiliated. This is not a 'natural' desire
in someone that should be satisfied, no matter how much producers of
these kind of movies try to pretend it is. The truth is, if you have
these kind of desires, you need therapy, you need healing from whatever
abuse you suffered from as a child. I found it also highly disturbing to
see Nicole Kidman's frighteningly masculine figure in this! When we see
her mostly naked, she literally looks like a teenage boy's body with a
female head, quite repulsive! Impressionable woman watch this and are
fooled into thinking that this is what a beautiful woman's body should
look like!

It's also endlessly frustrating that, once again, if Hollywood makes a
movie about a much older woman with a young man, there always has to be
something weird about it, as if healthy and loving relationships don't
exist between older women and young men. Wake up Hollywood! There has
been a massive cultural shift in society. Rather than repeating over and
over again the old fashioned backwards storyline of old man with much
younger woman, try writing movie scripts that have a star older female
lead and a much younger male lead.",2
426,"Nicole Kidman drinking milk off the floor?!

Omg - where to begin. This movie is trash and filth. It has nothing to

Does this not give ammo to weirdos who want to abuse women and showing
women who supposedly like it? Seeing Nicole drink from milk on the floor
was beyond disgusting and degrading. She should be ashamed of herself to
use her acting talents in such derogatory ways. And now we know what her
face looks like from the very beginning of an orgasm to the very end!
Great acting?... WAY too intimate for a talent of Nicole's stature. She
obviously wants to prove that she's still sexy but is this the cheap
gross way to do it? A resounding NO!! When a woman has self-worth and
knows she's a queen, she is not seeking domination by men in or outside
the bedroom. Can you imagine Cleopatra on all fours drinking milk off
the floor because a man told her to?!! Of course not!! She's in command
and would never allow such indignation. A good unique woman-empowering
film could have been Nicole conquering her inner demons and how they
developed in childhood. And by the end, we see an empowered woman who
never allows domination by a man in or out of the bedroom. But nope,
let's keep holding women back in the dark ages and keep normalizing it.

bit of everything. What was her Dom's reason for being there? What was

431,"Instinct on full display

Can anyone doubt that Nicole Kidman is one of the world's great
actresses? I certainly don't. What other actress of her generation could
so convincingly play a high-powered married mom/tech CEO who overcomes
lifelong sexual self-repression via a cunning, soft-spoken male intern
half her age who at once she cannot respect and yet cannot resist?
There's Julianne Moore, for sure. Likewise Hilary Swank and Charlize
Theron. Possibly Rachel McAdams and Emily Blunt. But Miss Kidman
delivers here in a way that perhaps even these actresses might not be
able to equal. Guided by the sensitive direction of Dutch native Halina
Reijn, Kidman puts on full display the many contradictions of feminism,
not to mention the impossibility of separating sexual desire and power.
And if she's playing her real self to an extent, well..so what?

""Babygirl"" has its antecedents -- ""Belle du Jour,"" ""Basic Instinct,""
""Fatal Attraction"" and Kidman's own turn in Kubrick's ""Eyes Wide Shut.""
But this film goes deeper emotionally. Even in subdued scenes, the
dramatic tension is unyielding. Our better instincts tell us from the
start of the affair that her character is not going to leave her husband
and two daughters, and run off with a brash, shallow, archetype Bad Boy,
and a highly invasive species at that. The larger point is that women,
contrary to what they may say outwardly, don't want a Nice Guy for a
partner. Is this instinct rational? Fair? No and no. It's just life.
Yes, even feminists on occasion crave submission, even in ways that
render her helpless and even abused. She's not getting that feeling from
her husband, superbly played by an increasingly preturbed Antonio
Banderas. Like it or not, BDSM fulfills a need for many people even as
it risks paying with fire.

I won't give away the story line, except to say that the movie has an
appropriately satisfying ending. Kidman's character ultimately doesn't
deny her animalistic, baby-like side; she simply transfers it to where
it matters. Go see ""Babygirl"" if you haven't already. And if you
haven't, crawl.",10

Would a matriarchy be any different?

For me the absolute pinnacle of the Erotic Thriller sub genre is Belle
De Jour and The Secretary. On seeing the trailer for babygirl I had high
hopes that it may be in the same vain as those aforementioned films.
Unfortunately however it has more in common with the likes of Fifty
Shades.

Romy (Nicole Kidman) is the CEO of a package delivery company, think
along the lines of Amazon. She has a loving husband, two daughters and a
thirst to be told what to do sexually. Her husband is unable to tend to
her desires therefore when a new intern with a skill hand for control
starts at her company she drops to her knees.

We often hear it said that men in positions of power enjoy being
sexually dominated as it's the one part of their life where they can
truly give up control. This film tries to turn the tables by having a
powerful women giving up her control for sexual pleasure. Interesting
concept however it's poorly explored and ultimately tries to say that a
women in that position would do exactly the same as a man. That is in
the sense of taking advantage of their position of power to get what
they want. That being said you have to ask yourself what's the point of
the film?

Romy is said to have developed an interest for kink at an early age
perhaps while she was growing up amongst cults. The film however never
really explores the reasoning behind her fantasies. They're instead
explained through just a few lines of dialogue. I can't help but feel
like the film as a whole would have been more interesting had it delved
more into her past rather than solely focusing on her present dilemma.

As for the dilemma at the heart of this film, it all revolves around if
the truth will ever come out and will she loose everything in the
process. Despite this risk being what turns Romy on it failed to turn me
on and ultimately I was left disappointed.",5

STAR RATING: ***** Brilliant **** Very Good *** Okay ** Poor * Awful

Romy (Nicole Kidman) is the high powered CEO of a successful New York
tech firm, and has a decent home life, married to theatre director Jacob
(Antonio Banderas) with angsty daughters Isobel (Esther McGregor) and
Nora (Vaughan Riley.) But inside lurks a deep, tormented emptiness, that
comes to the fore when she meets Samuel (Harris Dickinson), with whom
she begins a torrid affair based on domination and control, that comes
to have a devastating impact on everything she holds dear.

In what seem to be more sensitive, volatile times in theatre and
culture, the 'erotic thriller' or 'erotic drama', seems to come around
much more sparingly (with the exception of The Fifty Shades series.)
They were a staple of the 80's and 90's, with films like 1981's Body
Heat, and the classic Basic Instinct in the early 1990's. Here,
writer/director Halina Reijn delivers what is, at the very least, a
daring piece (aren't they all?) that explores 'forbidden fantasies', but
the result is not that satisfying.

Reijn, an accomplished actress who seems to have moved into directing,
has assembled an all star cast, from veterans Kidman and Banderas, to
relative newcomers, most notably Dickinson, who does at least project a
simmering intensity in his role as the irresistible tempter. It also
benefits from an unsettling, shuffling score, with a neat soundtrack
(most notably, George Michael's Father Figure, in an erotically charged
scene.) The problem is, there's just not enough depth or development
invested in any of these characters to get us to care sufficiently about
any of them, or the outcome of their plights. Making the near two hour
runtime something of a chore.

In a time where sex serves as more of a currency than ever due to the
advent of the internet, erotically themed films still hold some
pervasive interest. Sadly, Babygirl just lures you in and bores you
silly. **",4

It breaks boundaries on sexuality, women's equality on the matter, not

What first struck me was the way it was filmed. The director focused on
the characters, in a dynamic and fluid sort.

The soundtracks added to the tension.

immediatelly go from couple's love making into the woman being unhappy
and seeking for an extra lover. No reason, no explanation, no tension.
There was no point where it felt like any kind of danger is at place. 2)
Chemistry. Well sometimes it felt like there could be some but then the
film pushed us into awkward and bland situations between the lovers and
all of the eager was gone, left with big pile of cringe instead. 3)
Passion. The sex scenes were so boring I was shocked. Everything very
hidden yet under too much light. Nothing felt natural or with any amount
of need or animalistic eagerness. You need to help the tension and
drama. In this case the camera did the opposite. Too much lights,
nothing hidden, cold and soulless locations, static shots. But most of
all what took me out of the movie was the acting. Nicole's character was
such an unpleasant person with no depth or likeable qualities and her
lover acted like this was a joke to him. Teenager's approach to

all together created... well nothing really.",3

him attractive one but. He just looks goofy and skinny. And yet he has
an empire of audacity to think he is all that and a bag of chips. Child,
sit down. That is what she should've told him. In reality that's what
would've happened.

I did not make it to the end but judging by other reviews it's not worth
my time.

Only good thing about this was Antonio Banderas is still handsome as
ever and he played his role well.

447,"Babygirl

Rich and successful, company CEO Romy Mathis (Nicole Kidman) is happily
married to Jacob (Antonio Banderas) with two teen daughters. One day she
starts to have a passionate affair with a new young intern, Samuel
(Harris Dickinson) who provides her with the passion and danger that
hubbie no longer is. Things inevitably get tricky when Romy insists that
Samuel stays out of her private life. He thought, turning the affair to
his advantage starts to blackmail her and will talk to people in the
company if she doesn't do what he asks. The passion continues; she likes
it, she doesn't like it.

Whilst Kidman gives a strong, convincing performance here, the film
stands or falls on whether it is believable and frankly it isn't, either
on the relationship or the Corporate level.

I don't doubt that there are people out there who have wild passionate
corporate affairs involving drinking from saucers of milk with arrogant
idiots, but I wasn't sold on the idea here nor on the notion that a CEO
is in acute peril of losing their job because of they sleep with legal
age interns. Part of this may be to do with company rules on different
sides of the pond - in the UK, I doubt this sort of thing wouldn't
attract that much attention. Clearly this wants to be edgy and to join
the Hollywood gloss that is the Fatal Attraction / Basic Instinct /
Indecent Proposal etc set but despite Kidman, it doesn't really work and
in fact I found it rather silly and dull.",3
448,"Babygirl

Behind the perfect career and family image the CEO Romy is hiding lots
of skeletons in the closet. After meeting and get to know the young
intern in her company she realized that finally she met someone who can
fulfill all of her deepest darkest masochistic desires. Of course it has
something to do with the childhood trauma and the whole thing was
portrayed very well in the movie. I also really like the way the movie
has developed because in the middle of it l almost thought that I was
watching some BS. But if you are in the middle of deciding whether to
watch it or not then just give it a chance and watch till the end.

It's absolutely not fair to compare it to ""50 Shades of Grey"" because
""Babygir!"" has more substance, lots of things at stake, risks, deeper
meanings and you're not watching p*rn... When it comes to acting, Nicole
obvi was amazing. I just wanna mention that sometimes Harris D. Was ""bad
at it"" at least in my opinion... Idk, sometimes for me it just felt hard
to believe him (acting wise), like he wasn't trying hard enough, but
maybe it's just me.",8
449,"It could have been good with a 'real' older woman

On paper, the premise had promise: an older woman dominated by a man in
his twenties. Awkward? Yes. But at least a departure from the usual
tropes. I imagined a story that leaned into the real power of age - a
woman with intelligence, maturity, and lived wisdom undone by raw
desire, her composure slipping, her dominance tested. That could have
been electric.

Instead, what we got was a hollow performance of insecurity. Nicole
Kidman has, tragically, become unrecognisable - her face a battlefield
of Botox, fillers, and reconstruction that erase the very tool of her
craft: expression. Rather than embodying an older woman's undeniable
allure and authority, she came across as desperate, diminished, and
cringeworthy.

The film itself lurched into cliché, recycling unoriginal scenes with a
pornographic undertone so heavy-handed it collapsed under its own
tackiness. What might have been a bold exploration of female sexuality
and agency in later life was reduced to a hollow pantomime of lust.

Older women do not lose their power - they refine it. This film couldn't
even imagine that truth, and in the end, neither could Kidman.",1
450,"Baffling

Surprisingly unsexy, given the subject matter.

Did not see any real chemistry between the two main characters and found
nothing believable about their interactions, getting together, etc.

Even the musical choices throughout seemed out of place.

And sorry, but Nicole Kidman's face is such a distraction to me in
everything I watch her in these days.",3
451,"Babygirl's down on all fours........

It just occurred to me that seeing Nicole Kidman acting like a dog on
all fours and drinking milk from a dish like a cat is kind of
humiliating, not what I would have expected from the likes of Nicole
Kidman.....

Babygirl is a confusing game of attraction, sexual fantasies and
fetishes between Romy and Samuel. It is an awkward relationship and is
never really clear who started it. It leaves you wondering what is
really going on the whole time. They seem to be playing a game exploring
certain roles, but it isn't clear who initiated it. It could be Romy,
not being satisfied at home and seeing an opportunity to explore her
deep sexual desires and fantasies with a young intern, pays Samuel to
help her explore those fantasies. Or it could be Samuel, seeing an
opportunity to take advantage of Romy's interest in him and move himself
up the company ladder.

Or is it Jacob? I find it hard to believe that for nineteen years, Jacob
didn't realize that his wife and sexual partner was not really fulfilled
and living a lie sexually. It seemed odd that Samuel would show up
unexpectedly at the house twice and Jacob just didn't appear that
surprised. And the fight that Jacob and Samuel have just didn't seem
that intense to me, it seemed staged. Jacob is a Theater Director and
stages plays and works with actors. It is possible that Jacob staged the
whole scenario to give his wife a controlled affair to explore her
fantasies with someone Jacob trusted to keep their marriage together.

Or was the whole affair staged by Esme who knew Romy and concocted a
scheme using Samuel to move herself up the corporate ladder? You could
go in any direction with those theories, but it did seem as though Esme
approaching Romy to, in essence, blackmail her for a better position at
the company was only after Samuel told her about their affair. That kind
of rules out Esme having orchestrated the affair.

Whichever way the plot was intended, it does come across as very
awkward. I didn't really feel any great chemistry between Nicole Kidman
and Harris Dickinson, either because there wasn't any or the whole
affair was staged to begin with. I have seen Nicole in better sensual
erotic movies with more chemistry and feeling. Dead Calm, Birthday Girl
and Eyes Wide Shut come to mind. Babygirl also reminds me of Unfaithful
with Diane Lane and Richard Gere, although I think Unfaithful is a way
better movie.

So to wrap it up, for me it was just ok. The sensuality and fetishes
were a bit over the top, I get they were exploring the power and
submission thing but it just didn't feel that real to me. Like a badly
staged play. I didn't think much of Harris' Dickinson's acting but then
I haven't seen him in anything else so perhaps it was just the
awkwardness of the role in this movie. So yeah, meh........",5
452,EXTENDED 'CORN' TRAILER WITH TOO MUCH STORYLINE,4
453,This is only confusing if it's not relatable to you,8
454,"Seen the trailer, seen the movie..

Quite a boring film, to be honest.. I wasn't very interested at all in
seeing this film, the trailer looked ok but nothing that would call my
attention or interest me. I just found myself in the situation to watch
something and this one was it, so gave it a go.

As the title, there's not much more to it than what you see on the
trailer, maybe the last 15/20 minutes are a bit the consequences of the
rest of the film, but it's nothing surprising or worth of watching the
1:40 previous to that.

I chuckled a couple of times when the film started, but it got old
extremely fast and I was bored by the first half hour.

I didn't even think the film was sexy at all, the kinks that the
characters are into don't interest me at all, I watched it as I'd watch
a tree through the window.

The performances are ok, the strongest being Kidman, Dickinson has
proved to me through 3 movies he's not a very versatile actor, quite
expressionless and repetitive in his performances, one of those who play
himself in every movie, I won't be picking up any other movie because of
him, actually probably passing on them if he's on.

Not much else to say, it was very inconsequential and forgettable for
me, I won't be recommending it at all.",5
455,"Response to jorgesilvamarques

I feel entitled to reply back to jorgesilvamarques who hasn't seen the
film but feels entitled to comment because they feel 'bombarded'.

To answer your question: what if the roles were reversed?

All drama has a speculative angle. That's why it's a drama in the first
place.

I don't like the premise either but for entirely different reasons.

There are movies I won't watch purely because I know they are not my cup
of tea.

But at the end of the day they are just movies, to entertain, nothing
more.

Movies should be judged on how well they execute artistic expression,
not whether they are crusading some kind of morality.

Yes, infidelity is wrong, but it happens. Women do have fantasies. And
sordid thoughts of all sorts. That said, I don't necessarily want to
watch it played out on the big screeen, and that's okay.

I hope that answers your question.",5
456,"Failed to deliver

First of all, I wanted to like this, I like the plot very much, there is
so much potential.

But the whole writing, the character development, the pace of the movie,
it's just not there, it's shallow. There is no chemistry, no passion, no
tension, no nothing. A story like this should have layers, a
relationship like this should be so much more than ""my husband never
make me cum"", or ""I just want to be in control"". There's nothing like
that, and the erotic scenes, not erotic at all, it's neither passionate.

Before watching the movie, I thought Nicole Kidman would be a problem,
because to be completely honest, it's fair to say she might be ""too old""
for a film like this. But when the key ingredients are missing from the
movie, it doesn't really matter who is acting. I would say Nicole Kidman
is still Nicole Kidman, the film failed but she's not the problem. Other
characters, I just couldn't feel them, because the writing failed to let
me sink in.",3
457,"Definitely overrated

First of all it wasn't half as sexual as they said it was going to be
and I thought be honest with you it was kind of pathetic how she gave in
to his every whim when really he should have been giving in more to hers
and again wasn't a sexual at all so I thought it was going to be I've
seen way sexier and hotter movies that were way steamer. When Nicole
Kidman said she had too many orgasms making this movie her husband Keith
Urban must not have to try very hard to get her that orgasm because this
isn't really that orgasmic of a movie at all so that was just to push
the narrative for sure. I think.",5
458,"It kept me hooked the entire time.

I really liked the acting, I enjoyed the story, and it didn't feel
superficial at all. Nicole Kidman delivers a fearless performance, the
chemistry with Harris Dickinson feels raw and unsettling, and the story
goes far beyond superficial desire. It's a daring exploration of power,
vulnerability, and passion that kept me hooked until the very end.",8
459,"Appalling waste of time

Seriously bad casting and story .

Nicole Kidman looks embarrassed most of the time as well she should be.
The casting of Harris Dickson as the young intern is a joke. Seriously
bad acting from him and when husband (Antonio Banderas) finds out about
the pathetic affair you really want him to beat the hell out of him but
even that doesn't really happen.

Really bad effort to be a fifty shades of grey, which in itself is a
really bad movie.",1

What was Nicole thinking doing this piece of trash. Isn't 'Baby Girl'
Keith Urban's affectionate name for her, his wife? How insulting and
selfish that Nicole would even consider doing a movie with that title,
let alone the lead male whisper it to her. Very disturbing that you
would think it ok or that your partner could stomach seeing you being so
intimate. Was this the catalyst that has split them up maybe? He not
wanting her to do it and she doing it anyway. Not a movie I would want
to see my partner doing. Very disturbing Nicole.",1
461,"Missed chance

If they tried to make a #metoo film where it has been a female CEO
instead of a male CEO then they went wrong with the story line of the
mother who finely chooses herself over all, her roles. Because I think
that is a movie on its own.

That would also be a great storyline. There's a whole generation of 40+
women who have only been taught to be an excellent wife and excellent
mother, an excellent friend, but never if they learn to choose for their
selves. To give a word to Darren needs their desires and not what
society thinks about you. If they wanted to make a movie like that, they
should have had a Warm and loving mother, A good wife and maybe even a
CEO. But then you didn't want her to have an affair with her intern, you
wanted her to have an affair with someone random who kicked all the
boxes that she needed who gave her the sensation that she was worthy and
let her feel her again

now those two storylines Seem to be mixed up and therefore, half of the
people who watched it are focusing on the ""oh it is an intern it is so
wrong"" part. And the other half is only seeing the depressed woman.

Nicole Kidman is not made for his role. I've seen her shining in so many
movies. This is not one of them. There's no chemistry with herself, her
husband and her affair. Not to think about her relationship with her
daughters who was just flat

No, this was not my movie.",5
462,"I just personally needed a bit more substance attached to it.

'Babygirl' is sex and bugger all else. It features two of the more
freaky characters in cinematic history, they both kinda creeped me out
I'm not going to lie - I will never look at a tie in the same way again,
or a glass of milk for that matter. Kudos for creativity, I guess!

Nicole Kidman and Harris Dickinson do commit to their respective roles,
some of the noises coming out of the former were quite something to
witness. In fairness, if this is what they were going for then both
actors do a fine job. Antonio Banderas is at least there to add sort of
normality.

Impressively, aside from a few nips, there isn't much nudity in this,
how you show so much without showing barely anything is actually quite
the thing. I'm not against seeing films of an erotic nature, I just
personally need a bit more story substance attached to it. I'm

463,"great film on female sexuality, ignore the bad ratings!

I was hesitant to watch the film after seeing the trailer; thought it
was going to be another 50 Shades of Grey or something cheap.

It was completely different from what I imagined. Erotic, sensual,
imaginative, but also realistic. I could immerse myself completely and
follow the gaze of Nicole Kidman. The director certainly got female
sexuality right.

It may not be the most interesting plot-wise, but it's worth a watch if
you're tired of seeing sexuality that was male-centred on the big
screen.

The casting was great, but I imagine that even without the allures of
the main male and female casts, the film still would have worked well.
Which is to say, the appeal of the film did not depend on beautiful
people on screen. The central premise was enough to hold my attention.

something to strive for and give others a chance to shine on the screen.

Probably the best and most innovative studio today, A24 failed hard with
this one. With a name like Kidman, you'd expect them to give this piece

only that Kidman was in it. 15 minutes into the movie, I said to myself,
""This has to be a female director."" I swear I never missed guessing
this, not once. There is just something quite obvious in pictures when
it comes to female directors.

There is 0 chemistry between the leads, bad casting. The guy is so
ambiguous that you cant tell anything about him other than that he likes
to party and likes older women. How on earth do you make a lead this
shallow idk, that's art as well I guess. The female lead isn't much
better either, at moments I think she even breaks character and
genuinely laughs on camera, I cringed so hard I almost died. It took me
3 days to finally finish this movie. I had to stop watching it 3 times
because it didn't give me anything to hold on to. This could have been a
nice erotic thriller. The scene where he wants her to spread her legs
gave Basic Instincts vibes, but only this felt more like a parody.
Totally wasted nude Kidman all in all.

The premise here is one of a rather prosaic flavor, in that it involves
a common office romance, a situation that undoubtedly occurs with
regularity throughout workplaces all across America, if not the world.
The cinematic components that would differentiate this presentation as
compelling vis-a-vis typical similar stories is the lure of the big name
stars involved, which would also reasonably create associated
expectations of quality writing and overall direction. Unfortunately, no
such developments are on display. The complicating twist to this
particular tale is the aspect of the gender-sex-power factors that could
potentially make for complex and interesting relationships, but don't
hold out hope though because it's not gonna happen. There's an attempt
at a sort of mildly kinky sensuous scenario that mostly seems
gratuitous, or even pointless. Trying to figure out the ultimate point
or overall sensibility of this movie may prove baffling. Meanwhile the
soundtrack echoes and reinforces the cheesiness of the production, thus
at least proving cohesive. Christmas tree interiors with Kidman are
reminiscent of "" Eyes Wide Shut "" yet exist simply as decor for randomly
uninteresting characters wandering around spewing melodramatic dialog.
Kidman's Romy as a sexually frustrated power figure never gets the
benefit of having her psycho-sexual motives examined with any depth or
insight, which could have been the force that propelled this narrative
with conviction, instead of being a show of silly superficiality.",3

Critically, ""Babygirl"" holds a 76% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes,

Notably, Kidman's performance has been widely praised, with Time
magazine highlighting it as one of the finest of her career, capturing
both vulnerability and subdued emotion.

The New York Post also commended the intense chemistry between the leads
and the film's exploration of workplace taboos.

In summary, ""Babygirl"" offers a though provoking narrative with strong

'Babygirl' is a an extremely disappointing directorial follow up to

I can't get over how unimaginably safe this movie is. Everything is shot
in the least daring way possible. And the story refuses to go anywhere
audacious or take any chances at all. There's a quite brilliant review
on Letterboxd that says: ""I've watched actual porn with more compelling
plotlines."" And I couldn't agree more.

Worst of all is the complete lack of chemistry between the two leads. I
understand it wasn't entirely about ""chemistry"" and she was searching
for something else. But surely some chemistry wouldn't have hurt.
Compare this to 'Unfaithful' where the steam was almost coming through

The first half of BG is wonderfully made. The acting is superb, the

make a weak husband stay loyal, a strong CEO become blackmailed, the
same strong CEO reject her boss and yet submit to her underling, etc,

The movie skirts around these issues without ever dealing with them in
any detail, leaving the audience to fill in the blanks.

titillating. The story is as old as time but the way the characters were

At least that would have been exciting.",2
481,"Ironically safe.

This opens with Nicole Kidman pretending to orgasm while having sex with
Antonio Banderas, before rushing off to watch porn. Sadly that sets the
base tone of what's to come, so to speak. They are Romy and Jacob. Jacob
being largely redundant in the story as you might've guessed. This is
Romy's world, one in which she runs a warehouse robotics company,
juggled with modern day motherhood. She's in charge, but she's hiding
something. A secret craving, one that's brought out by new intern Samuel
(Harris Dickinson). He's brashly confident and sees through Romy's
powerful controlled facade, but he's more of a creepy stalker than eager
intern. It's all rather implausible, troubling and feels a bit sterile,
but mostly it's just awkward viewing and a little infuriating. Kidman is
very good though and I have to admit, Dickinson is pretty magnetic. He
was great in Scrapper (2023) and even better here. I still kinda hate
this though. Romy wants to be dominated. Samuel wants to dominate her.
The affair then should work, but it's difficult to make stuff like this
work on screen without being potentially problematic. It's not easy to
watch and there's nothing wrong with challenging cinema. If you're going
to push buttons though, you'd better be sure you're bloody good at it.
This though, although edgy on the surface quickly turns into a run of
the mill thriller as Romy's secret life threatens to unravel her
personal and professional one. That might sound an exciting narrative,
but it's ironically too safe to do anything truly interesting. It does
have some good needle drops though, who doesn't love a bit of INXS and
George Michael. It's not a bad film, it just feels like more could've
been done with it and I'm sure there's an audience for this, but I don't
think I'm it.",5

Just awful. For years I thought, ""Who's That Girl?"" was the worst movie
I had ever seen, but ""Babygirl"" has taken it's place. Why Nicole Kidman
and Antonio Banderas would sign on for this is beyond me. Besides there
not being any chemistry between Nicole Kidman and Harris Dickinson,
there is no explanation of why a woman would let herself be treated that
way. I couldn't care less about any of the characters and should have

it out to the end. I can't believe I stayed awake during this travesty.

it's worth a watch maybe just for shock value and if you're into kinky
submissive sex then you will love this.

Nicole is completely naked in several scenes which is interesting in
itself. She is in incredible shape and obviously works very hard at it.

A tantalizing exploration of repressed sexual fantasies as well as an
audacious affirmation of women's inherent desires and passions.

However, it falls short in establishing a robust narrative groundwork,
despite having all the necessary elements at disposal.

As a result, the emphasis leans more towards eroticism rather than
delivering a compelling storyline that could have heightened both the
tension and the stakes ingrained deeply into the narrative.

The only standout aspect was Nicole Kidman, whose courageous and
confident depiction of vulnerability and resentment left a significant
impression.",5

excitement than Fifty Shades of Gray did. I get turned on so much when a
dominating man says "" good boy "" to me just like she does. That's how I
feel, apparently the play writer has the same kind of feelings. I'm so
happy there's a movie like this explaining the concept/ fetish to more

WOW!",9
489,"CE O-face

Whilst it may give the impression of being a salacious time, I have to
admit that my overall lasting impression of ""Babygirl"" was one of
boredom, rather than anything else.

Romy Mathis (Nicole Kidman) is the CEO of a tech company who lives a
life where she is very much in control. She is married to theatre
director Jacob (Antonio Banderas) and though their marriage is loving,
and they have two children, for her, the physical side of the it has
never been what she wanted it to be. She slowly begins an affair with
Samuel (Harris Dickinson), an intern at her company. She's attracted to
the idea that he is in control of the relationship and initiates small
(and consensual) 'humiliations' on her, as part of the act. Things
progress until one day she comes home to find Samuel at her house,
chatting with her family.

Maybe part of the problem is that ""Babygirl"" marketing sells the film as
one that it really isn't. They phrase ""erotic thriller"" is used and the
trailer includes the arrival at the house scene, which makes it look
like it skews close to ""Fatal Attraction"" for example. It's not actually
that sort of film though, it's a treatise on power and sex within
various relationships. Part of the reason I didn't particularly enjoy
the film is that I like a narrative and I'm not sure ""Babygirl"" really
has one. The relationship takes a long time to be properly established
and even at its height it's not that explicit.

This is going to be difficult to talk about without spoilers, and I want
to keep the review free of those, so I'll say that the conclusion of the
film I don't think really earns the two 'triumphant' moments it ends
with. One of which is dropped in out of nowhere and the other feels like
we're missing the key moments where the resolution happened.

I will say that Nicole Kidman is extraordinary though and it's almost
worth watching the film just for her performance (and the music).
Almost, but for me, not quite.",5

the details in this movie that feel all wrong. Like something was lost
in translation from the director's European sensibility, or frozen in
time from when the script was written a few years ago. I won't get into
specifics to avoid spoilers.

Billed as an erotic thriller, but where are the thrills? There is no
tension in this movie. Most of the juice is squeezed from the sheer
awkwardness and humiliation of Kidman's performance in her sub-dom
sessions with her intern (who to me comes off only as a mumbling creep
and not remotely attractive or interesting). Characters do not act like
realistic people when presented with the challenges and revelations that
the plot delivers to them. It's so alien.",5

One of the worst films I've seen. Indifferent, without originality. A

What a shame to end a career like this......Unfortunately, every actor
should have self-awareness and choose roles appropriate to their
reputation and the quality they have demonstrated so far, while
maintaining their dignity and self-respect. Nicole in this film fell
very low, figuratively and literally, playing a role that now belongs to
a younger generation of actresses or to those who, despite the signs of
time, remain charming and desirable. Nicole did neither. Overloaded with
botox and I don't know what else, remaining cold in her role, failing to
externalize the supposed embarrassment and desire that a middle-aged
woman feels for a younger male, she becomes ridiculous to the point of
repulsive in several scenes. Maybe it's her disgusting ""reddish"" hair?
What can I say. Disappointment.....",1

""Dang! An erotic thriller"", you thought. Ice on the cake: a reverse one!

of wrinkles, power, and money. You've caught yourself salivating a
little. Careful there, don't get too excited! I'm afraid you're gonna
have to put the brakes on that too.

This film's about a swan-song. A woman who will have the audacity to
live one last extramarital affair while there is still time. Filling the
void. We find ourselves stuck between a low Fifty Shades of Grey (2015)
and a pale copy of Fatal Attraction (1987). The fantasy of the
businesswoman who dreams of being humiliated. The cliché isn't very
sophisticated, and yet! A luminous miracle in stealth mode tho: the
scene of Nicole all alone on the floor, Mozart Lacrimosa mixed with a
theater dialogues in the background. Great scene.

My rating is directed at Nicole Kidman's great performance, true to
herself: deeply human, comfortable with the ambiguity of a both strong
and fragile woman, moving with ease from one emotion to the next.

A film worth seeing if you accept its inherent limitations, due to the
emptiness of the screenplay and the limitations of most of its actors.

seems overwhelmed despite playing a role that poses no great artistic

I recently watched the movie ""Baby Girl,"" and it truly left a lasting

complexities of her struggles with family, love, and self-discovery

The performances are absolutely stellar, with the lead delivering a
heartfelt portrayal that pulls you into her journey. You can't help but
root for her as she faces adversity and fights to carve out her own

significant and relatable.

Visually, ""Baby Girl"" is striking, with cinematography that beautifully
captures both the intimate and larger-than-life moments of the
protagonist's life. The soundtrack complements the narrative perfectly,
enhancing the emotions conveyed throughout the film.

Here's the thing with this movie - all Nicole Kidman's character had to
do is say 'no' right at the start, and that would have been the end of
that.

Instead, we have two A-list actors creating soft porn and very little
else.

Kidman won an award for acting in this, but that was more about her
ability to fake a climax, which should probably be worrying for Keith
Urban, than it was the acting itself when not in a sex scene.

There's no real plot to the film other than Kidman doesn't orgasm with
her husband, Banderas, so she's feeling bored and frustrated. An intern
catches her eye and he becomes the controlling force.

This film was some attempt at recreating Fatal Attraction, Basic
Instinct, Eyes Wide Shut, and Fifty Shades, none of which it managed to
capture properly.

I'd avoid it unless you really really like to see Nicole Kidman having

496,"Just your regular Netflix-esque non serious drama

This film's story is centered around obedience and control. The more
control one has, the more power they have over their ""prey"". Feminism
also plays a small but profound role for Kidman's character.

Notwithstanding the good acting of Kidman and Dickinson, there are some
faults to the film. The film's quality strongly reminds of a streaming
film release (the film got a theatrical release at first). Moreover the
film's main plot is in vain and is literally a dead end train: Going
nowhere. It's just that the main character has a ""purpose"", of some
sorts.

establish a coherent story and strong characters, were in vain in the

497,"When Star Power Cannot Compensate for Thin Storytelling

Babygirl, directed by Halina Reijn and starring Nicole Kidman, has been
touted as a daring erotic thriller exploring female desire and power.
Yet, beneath the glossy surface, the film struggles with fundamental
cinematic flaws that prevent it from delivering a compelling experience.

1. Lack of Psychological Depth

One of the most glaring issues is the absence of psychological
background for the main characters. Romy (Nicole Kidman) and Samuel
(Harris Dickinson) are reduced to archetypes-CEO and young
intern-without any convincing motivations, fears, or inner conflicts.
The audience is never given insight into their histories or why they
make the choices they do. As a result, their actions feel mechanical,
and the tension that could arise from authentic emotional stakes is
entirely missing.

2. Absence of Chemistry

Despite being central to the narrative, the relationship between Kidman
and Dickinson feels empty. There is no palpable chemistry; their erotic
encounters, which should be charged with intimacy and vulnerability,
instead feel staged and performative. Kidman's commitment to the erotic
scenes appears restrained, while Dickinson's performance fails to convey
any real desire or pleasure, leaving the viewer uninvested in their
interactions. A film that relies so heavily on sexual tension cannot
afford such disconnection between its leads.

3. Storytelling Deficiencies

Babygirl suffers from an underdeveloped plot. Beyond the surface-level
affair, there is no narrative propulsion or meaningful exploration of
the characters' journey. Key moments that should reveal growth or
consequence pass without impact, creating a story that is more a
sequence of events than a cohesive arc. The lack of narrative depth
makes the film feel superficial and unengaging.

4. Star Power vs. Substance

Nicole Kidman's iconic presence is undeniable, yet her star power alone
cannot elevate a film that lacks substance. The movie seems to lean
heavily on her celebrity status, as if her name alone could carry the
weight of the story. Unfortunately, audiences are left questioning
whether Babygirl would have been made at all if not for Kidman's
involvement. A powerful actress deserves material that challenges her,
not a hollow vehicle that underutilizes her talent.

Conclusion

While Babygirl markets itself as a provocative exploration of desire, it
ultimately falls short. Thin characterization, absent chemistry, and a
lack of meaningful storytelling make the film more style than substance.
Nicole Kidman delivers her signature presence, but it is insufficient to
rescue a movie that feels superfluous and undercooked. For a film
centered on erotic tension and emotional complexity, the absence of both
renders Babygirl an underwhelming experience.",4

woman who seemingly has it all; CEO of a tech company, has a loving
husband in Jacob (Antonio Banderas), and two young daughters in Isabel
(Esther McGregor) and Nora (Vaughn Reilly). Unfortunately, her sex life
is unfulfilled. Cue the new interns at her company, one of which is the
hunky young man Samuel (Harris Dickenson), who becomes her mentee, and
then a lot more. This movie is fascinating in different ways. There are
interesting ideas here, speaking frankly about sex, consent, power
dynamics, and figuring out what you want in life, like Romy does. This
is more of a self-love story. It's definitely an awards-worthy
performance from Kidman. The chemistry is there. The score fits the
sassy tone. This movie just doesn't pull me in. I appreciate the
boldness and vulnerability portrayed here, but I couldn't get behind the
protagonist. Normally I don't get uncomfortable with sex scenes in
movies, but for some reason, I did here. There isn't much more to say
about this one. Movie critics are enjoying it even more than casual

510,"Beautifully Shot but Deeply Flawed - A Frustrating Experience

Babygirl is a beautifully shot film that ultimately stumbles under the
weight of its own narrative inconsistencies and poorly developed
characters. Although there are some remarkable elements, they are
overshadowed by storytelling decisions that strain believability and
emotional engagement.

Visually, the film is stunning. The cinematography captures breathtaking
locations and atmospheric scenery, creating a vivid and sensual mood
that immediately pulls the viewer in. The ""sexually charged"" moments
between Romy (Nicole Kidman) and Samuel (Harris Dickinson) are among the
film's most compelling sequences. When isolated from the broader plot,
these scenes feel raw, authentic, and emotionally credible. They offer a
glimpse into what Babygirl could have been: a daring exploration of
forbidden desires. Special credit goes to Kidman for taking such risks
with her role-it's clear she put herself on the line, and her
performance is fearless.

However, when viewed within the context of the full story, these
strengths become disconnected. Romy's character arc quickly descends
into implausibility. Her reckless behavior-jeopardizing her career,
family, and reputation for a relationship that feels shallow and
manipulative-strains credulity. It's difficult to reconcile her supposed
status as a successful CEO with the naive, impulsive choices she makes.
The psychological motivation behind her actions remains frustratingly
underdeveloped, and as a result, Romy loses the audience's sympathy
about halfway through the film.

Samuel, portrayed by Harris Dickinson, is equally problematic. His
character is mostly a caricature of arrogance and selfishness, rarely
offering any real depth. Although there are brief glimpses of
vulnerability, they come too late and too inconsistently to make him a
truly compelling figure.

The supporting characters further diminish the film's credibility.
Sophie Wilde's portrayal of Esme, Romy's feminist secretary, feels
painfully forced and inorganic. Rather than serving as a natural part of
the story, her character comes across as a political statement awkwardly
inserted into the plot. Many reviewers noted-and I agree-that her
presence feels more like a lecture than authentic characterization. As
someone with real-world experience navigating similar issues, I found
this portrayal unrealistic and frustratingly heavy-handed.

Other reviewers have pointed out that while Babygirl aims to explore
complex themes of power, desire, and agency, it often falls into clichés
and shallow archetypes. Like many of them, I felt that the film wanted
to provoke but lacked the narrative finesse to justify its boldness. The
emotional beats don't land because the characters' decisions feel less
like the result of inner conflict and more like clumsy plot devices.

Despite its gorgeous cinematography, atmospheric tension, and Nicole
Kidman's brave performance, Babygirl ultimately collapses under the
weight of its contrived story, unbelievable character arcs, and forced
social commentary. While it has moments of interest and even brilliance
in isolation, as a whole, it fails to deliver a coherent or compelling
narrative.",5
511,"Unconvincing, confusing, unsettling

Plotlines of an older woman having an affair with much younger man are
not exactly new and movies on such May--December relationships have been
made earlier. In this movie a middle aged woman ( Nicole Kidman) with a
loving husband and two teenaged children holding a senior position in an
organisation gets hopelessly infatuated with a handsome much younger
intern ( Harris Dickinson) of the same organisation. While she feels
guilty about this and wants to end it, he feels it is okay to continue
the affair. As the relationship deepens he begins to wield power over
her and controls her while she turns obedient, submissive and docile.
This continues for some time till she realises that this path cannot
have a happy ending.

Director Halina Rejin doesn't quite get the message across and the
jumbled narrative of neurotic plus erotic is utterly confusing,
unconvincing and incomprehensible for the average audience. The
powerplay and the gender dynamics are stretched to uncomfortable and
unsettling limits. Nicole has given an award winning performance no
doubt. I think the explicit scenes could have been reduced for better
acceptance by audiences. Sometimes suggestive scenes are adequate and
they don't have to be graphic and in your face.",5

517,"Babygirl"" - reality? Hypnose? A Story About Power, Desire, and Inner
Freedom

Babygirl is not a conventional love story. Desire is present in every
scene, but this is not a film about seduction for its own sake. It's
about the complex territory where power, vulnerability, and identity .
Babygirl is not, at its core, a film about sex - it's about trauma,
perception, and the fragile boundary between reality and what we
construct in our own minds. I watched it again and again... so many
symbols.

The surface version of the ending is simple: her boss tells her Samuel
is in Tokyo - the ""official"" truth, the version for everyone else. Yet
the very next shot shows Samuel in their hotel room, with the dog,
exactly as before. This contradiction is the film's most deliberate
ambiguity. Is it real? Or is it just in her head?

If you watch closely, the clues point to hypnosis. In the therapy
session, during trance, we see rapid, fragmented flashes: the hotel
room, Samuel, the dog climbing over her. These images reappear almost
identically in the final scene. That repetition isn't accidental - it's
a cinematic breadcrumb trail suggesting that the final moment might be a
mental reconstruction, not a physical meeting.

The dog is the perfect ""red thread"" through the story: 1. In the first
scene, it doesn't even seem to be Samuel's - he calms it with a tone of
control, not affection.

2. When she visits him in the hospital, the dog becomes emotionally
linked to him - a symbol of comfort.

3. In hypnosis, the dog is placed right in the fantasy of reconnection.

4. In the final scene, the dog is there exactly as it was in the trance,
which could mean the entire ending is a replay of that mental image.

The lighting, the framing, and the dreamlike quality of the final shot
match the ""oniric"" tone of the hypnosis sequence, not the grounded
realism of the rest of the film. And the boss's ""He's in Tokyo"" line
works like an anchor to reality - everything after it may be her mind's
rebuttal: ""No. I can still see him."" Then there's the line when her
husband asks if Samuel is ""relevant"" to her as a director, and she
replies, ""We're all irrelevant."" On the surface, it's cold, dismissive.
Symbolically, it's a declaration that objective reality and social
labels no longer matter to her. What matters is her own experience - and
if she creates it in her mind, it's just as valid as if it happened in
the flesh.

This ties perfectly into her profession. She doesn't sell objects or
standard services - she sells stories. A beautifully packaged version of
reality where people are buying a feeling and an image, not something
tangible.

In her career, she masters the art of selling perceptions.

In her personal life, she uses the same skill to create in her mind a
closure reality never gave her.

That's why the Harvest scene is so layered. On one level, it's just a
product launch - an innovative robot tied to emotional intelligence,
making it a standout in the fictional market she describes. But for
those catching the subtext, there's irony: she publicly credits her
husband Jacob with the idea of merging cold technology with empathy,
while their own marriage lacks that same emotional connection. Is it a
sincere professional nod, or a quiet jab wrapped in a smile?

There's a pivotal psychological moment when her husband asks if Samuel
is ""relevant"" to her as a director, and she replies: ""We are all
irrelevant."" On the surface, it sounds cold and defensive - a quick way
to shut the topic down. But symbolically, it's a declaration that no
role, no social label, and no formal relationship truly matter to her
anymore. The only thing that counts is her personal experience and how
she chooses to live it.

In the context of the ending, this becomes crucial: if ""everyone is
irrelevant,"" (as she says to Jacob) then objective reality itself is
secondary. What matters is the reality she creates for herself - even if
it exists only in hypnosis. That's why, for her, the final scene with
Samuel is equally valid whether it happened physically or only in her
mind.

The beauty of Babygirl is that it refuses to give you a universal key.
You can watch it as a romantic ambiguity - believing Samuel is truly
there. Or you can see it as a deeply psychological resolution - her
mind, in hypnosis, building the perfect final meeting so she can let go.
Both versions are valid, because the film's real question isn't ""Is this
real?"" but ""Does it matter?"" Sometimes, what happens in your mind can
change you as much as something that happens in real life. My question:
is it all under hypnosis? After she met him?",10

Thank you for reminding me of what D/s is supposed to feel like, but

Babygirl explores how people build their lives around control and
appearances, but end up starving their deeper needs. Romy's affair isn't
really about lust, it's her psyche forcing her to confront the part of

The film suggests that intimacy and self-acceptance only come when we

powerful older woman played by Nicole Kidman, who gets involved with her
much younger intern. The idea of power and vulnerability in
relationships is definitely interesting, and Kidman gives a strong
performance. However, the story sometimes felt a bit slow, and some of
the scenes were pretty intense. I couldn't always connect with the
characters, but the way the film explores complex emotions and
boundaries in life did make me think. It's not a bad watch, but it
didn't totally hit the mark for me.

However the end didn't make any sense to me. It eventually felt like old
people learning to communicate about sexual compatibility and
preferences.",5
525,"All for money, not to sell an idea

I recently watched *Babygirl* starring Nicole Kidman, and I have to say,
I'm giving it a rating of 5. While Nicole Kidman attempts to deliver a
strong and committed performance-she makes you wonder she has accepted
this role for money

From the start, I felt like the story leaned too heavily on familiar and
overused themes of power, desire, and complicated relationships. Instead
of offering new insights or emotional depth, it seemed to recycle old
tropes without much payoff. The characters, including Kidman's, lacked
real chemistry and depth, which made it hard for me to connect with or
care about what was happening on screen.

The pacing was slow in parts, and the film's ambiguous take on sensitive
topics like consent and manipulation left me more frustrated than
thoughtful. Honestly, I don't think movies like this are in the best
interest of the audience. They risk alienating viewers by focusing on
shock value and unresolved themes rather than genuine storytelling.

In the end, while I can appreciate Kidman's effort and the film's
stylish look, *Babygirl* just didn't resonate with me. I wouldn't
recommend it to others looking for a meaningful or entertaining movie
experience.",5
526,Gripping movie with a questionable ending,8
527,"A hollow ""empowerment"" fantasy with no accountability",1
528,"Awkward and cringeworthy

Possibly one of the most cringeworthy films I have ever come across.

The interactions between the main characters didn't feel natural at all,
and certain situations that occurred just wouldn't happen in the real
world, making this simply unrealistic. The erotic scenes are cringy and
somewhat unnecessary, one gets the gist on a scene like that, you can
have a few seconds and then move on. This isnt porn, are they trying to
be!? Who knows. Anyway, the cuts were too long and it just felt uneasy
to watch. I would say avoid it and don't waste your time.",1
529,"Not what it seems

This film explores many issues that the modern woman faces in society.
Some of those issues are how society makes us women feel ashamed about
our sexual desires and how aging is a terrible thing. Though, as
important as these issues are, the film failed to portray them properly.
The reason it falls flat is because they were not able to explore the
full length of the problems. It all seemed and felt very superficial. In
fact, at one point in the film, the plot was going nowhere. It's like
they had the idea, but it never brew.....and it is very easy to tell
because the end felt very rushed and unrealistic.",5
530,"What a terrible waste of time

I figured this movie was going to be awful after all the pre-publicity
around it.

Nicole Kidman is showing her age and wasn't very convincing at all.

There was absolutely nothing erotic about the movie.

Harris Dickinson has to be far and away the worst actor I have seen in a
long time. He couldn't deliver a decent line if his life depended on it.

Antonio Banderas was the best actor in the movie.",1
531,"Positive review

This is the best movie i have watched. Its characters are perfect.
Babygirl is a cinematic masterpiece that will leave audiences spellbound
and eager for more. The 2024 film is a tour-de-force that explores
themes of identity, family, and the complexities of human relationships.

The movie tells the story of Babygirl, a young woman who finds herself
at a crossroads in her life. As she navigates the challenges of
adulthood, Babygirl must confront her own demons and learn to let go of
the past.

The film features stunning performances from the entire cast, with
delivering a standout performance as the titular character. The
chemistry between the actors is palpable, and the dialogue is witty and
engaging.

One of the standout elements of ""Babygirl"" is its cinematography. The
film features breathtaking visuals, with a keen attention to detail that
immerses the viewer in the world of the story. The score is equally
impressive, perfectly capturing the mood and tone of each scene.

Where ""Babygirl"" truly shines, however, is in its thoughtful and nuanced
exploration of its themes. The film raises important questions about
identity, family, and the complexities of human relationships, and it
does so with a sensitivity and empathy that is all too rare in modern
cinema.

Overall, ""Babygirl"" is a must-see film that will resonate with audiences
long after the credits roll. With its stunning performances,
breathtaking cinematography, and thoughtful exploration of its themes,
this movie is a true masterpiece that will leave you spellbound and
eager for more.",10
532,Ultimately disappointing,4
533,"29 mins in... 😆

29 mins in... 😆. Saucy. Perhaps aimed at the female viewer. I'm hooked,
laughing and thinking...""eh up"" this is better than 50 shades! Probably
because I am over 50. It's a very daring idea and naughty, bit of a
guilty pleasure (at 41:09). I'm not sure if i want to continue with it
or crack on with Saturday chores! 😆",5
534,"Good, but had the potential to be great",4
535,"Fake thriller

Despite great casting, everything about this film felt fake. From the
first minutes of that suspenseful OST, which is the only ""thriller""
element in the film, I just couldn't buy into the story. And what
happened to the FL's face? She'd scare the guy away faster than attract.
I'd say I prefer Love and Leashes, at least it is entertaining.",2
536,"Great acting as always by Antonio.

Well my main reason for watching this Was Antonio banderas and I'm glad
I saw it because he gave such an amazing performance as always , he's
just the best.

The whole film was quite a bit of a weird rollercoaster of emotions ,
especially the main character led by the great actress Nicole Kidman
she's great I liked her performance in Kubrick's ""eyes wide shut"" and in
this film she is kind of the same character believe it or not I think
like the whole film has some vibes that are very very similar to
Kubrick's ""Eyes Wide Shut"" which is what made the film a bit more
watchable I guess.

This movie's whole idea I wasn't totally interested in apart of how she
handles her relationship in both ways ( from Samuel and Jacob) and stuff
like that.

Antonio banderas is my favorite actor ever he starred in my favorite
film ever which is ""Puss in boots (2011)"" and now I see this film
because of him and he DELIVERS an amazing performance ESPECIALLY on the
last 40ish minutes of the film , his character is relatable and he is
such An amazing dude I am so so glad that A24 chose Antonio Banderas to
be in this film. 8/10.",8
537,"New exciting movie

I'm really excited to watch Baby girl movie, The trailer looks
incredible, they made want to watch it. The constant power changes were
well played. That3 is3 very clear. Also the small neances of the words
in between. The guys have nailed it, though it makes you feel
uncomfortable sometimes 🤣🤣 but I like it very well. Nicole is something
else lol. Though I haven't finishe it yet but that one is a banger
movie. The visuals are very stunning that is excellent. Based on what I
have seen, the movie promises to be a very thrilling ride. I jus love to
watch how it ends. I'm just curious hey, Hope everyone will like it the
way I did. No time to waste just go and download it.",10
538,"Raw , messy and real

I thoroughly enjoyed the performance of the actors in this film. Many
erotic scenes were awkward and messy , and i read many reviews saying
they felt bad watching them. However i appreciated that the scenes felt
""real"" because of their messiness and they had this sense of the
entirety not being ""choreographed"" which made it more believable. Really
enjoyed it! Nicole Kidman is extraordinarily talented and i loved how
vulnerable she became to play this part.",8
539,Written off from life itself,10
540,"Raw, erotic as hell and fun... but why Nicole Kidman?",8
541,"Best thriller of 2024

I went into this movie expecting the worst romance adaptation of a twist
on BDSM, and I ended up experiencing the best psychological thriller I
have seen in over a decade. Nicole Kidman's acting is stellar, Antonio
Banderas plays The tortured husband divinely well, and even the
daughters contribute to the deeper meaning of the film in a way that I
had to watch the movie multiple times to grasp. This movie never gets
old, and I am ashamed that the media portrayed it as a Fifty Shades of
Grey type when it's not even close to the same genre.",10
542,"Max your life...

Nicole Kidman is ""Babygirl"" in this rare electrifying adult erotic
drama, she's perverse, juicy and fun. My valuation for ""Babygirl"" is
intelligence and unpolished sensibility understands that complicated
characters can be seductive, even if their behavior is sometimes
decidedly unlikable! This back and forth between assuredness and doubt
also makes ""Babygirl"" a refreshing look at BDSM and questions of consent
and desire, brutally honest film that stands out from the rest.. Nicole
Kidman is unafraid to have her character play out all the wobbles that
come with negotiating one another's boundaries, reinforcing how pleasure
comes from good communication. Nicole Kidman has hottest sex scenes to
capture something genuine about women's erotic experience in the age of
control..!?",9
543,"Yawn

OMG this is soooo boring. I hate all the characters and their weird sex
nonsense and messed up chemistry (or lack of). But it did give me a
chance to look over old photos on my phone which was nice. Still giving
it 3 stars as a) it can't be on the same level as Melania (need to
reserve 1 star for those that truly deserve it) b) the wife liked it
(happy wife happy life) and c) there's a dog briefly in it (and I like
dogs). Truth be I didn't finish it as I don't hate my self that much.

Does this contain spoilers? Only if the spoiler is it's utter cr@p.",3
544,"What was this?

It took me about a month to watch this due to being so disinterested.
The scenes kept cutting at extremely random times to where it looked
like they were unfinished. Nicole Kidman's wig drew more attention than
the actual rest of the movie. The plot was all over the place and hard
to follow. This was a horrible watch.",3
